# Turtleduck

The turtleduck is a creature that tends to swim and flock towards warmer climates. However, these creatures will seldom be seen in other areas. Where such a creature comes from, no-one knows, but it's adorable. Turtleducks act quite peaceful and loving towards creatures who don't seem to be  a threat.  
The name clearly describes what it is, a turtle-duck hybrid. The turtleduck has the head, neck and tail of a duck, but the body, shell and legs of a turtle. These new features make for great swimmers.  
Once threatened, the turtleduck will try to defend itself and its chicks with a sharp peck. If the threat appears to be too much, the turtleduck will retreat. A creature like this will need to be swayedwith food or other offerings to gain its trust. Once gained, the turtleduck tends to remember who you are and will come for more food or to be more welcoming in their approaches.
