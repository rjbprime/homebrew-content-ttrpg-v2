# Chapter 1 &ndash; Table Guidelines

<div id="Basic-Etiquette">

## Basic Etiquette

</div>

Outlined below are several points of basic etiquette, that I as a DM expect to be adhered to by the players in my campaigns, and think are important for a comfortable flow of the game and to guarantee a pleasant experience for all participants.

<div id="Not-Personal">

## It’s not personal

</div>

Keep personal conflicts out of the game and don’t let disagreements escalate into arguments, we’re here to have fun.

<div id="Quiet">

## Quiet in the back

</div>

When the GM is explaining something, try and keep chatter to a minimum. Many times, important details can easily be missed if you aren’t paying full attention. When entering a new room, meeting a new person, or encountering a monster for the first time, it’s generally a good idea to take a second to hear what the GM is saying about it.

<div id="On-Time">

## Be on time

</div>

When the game starts is when the game starts. Being prompt is an important bit of etiquette and shows respect to both your fellow players and the DM. If you can’t make the session due to an emergency or on longer notice an important family fest for example, just let me know as soon as you know and as long in advance as possible.

If you want to be part of a campaign I run though, in general it is assumed that you are willing to reliably schedule around “game night” and show up, so we can continue or story with all adventurers on board.

<div id="Too-Far">

## Too far is too far

</div>

If anyone at the table is uncomfortable with a situation or series of events, they’re perfectly justified in speaking up about it. The game might stop then while we discuss what happened and see how we can prevent issues in the future or it may continue with an after session or off week meeting to follow up. If something feels wrong, be sure to say something, no one will think less of you for it.

<div id="Heroes">

## You’re the hero! (but so are they&hellip;)

</div>

It’s easy to be caught up in a “larger than life” persona—that is actually the entire point of the game, really. That being said, everyone deserves and needs their moment in the spotlight to actually participate. Speak up and take action so you aren’t left behind, but be sure to let others get a word in occasionally. It’s a lot more fun if everyone works together.

<div id="Metagame">

## The Metagame

</div>

Metagaming to a degree is okay, for example reminding someone of their own class features or capabilities in combat or standard play is perfectly fine, and is in fact encouraged. When discussing plans during combat you should consider how you would be communicating in-character to avoid the NPCs overhearing you. Granted, as long as you provide a reasonable explanation I will generally let it slide by.

<div id="Seen-That">

## I’ve seen that before!

</div>

If you recognize a monster and remember its weaknesses, it would be pointless and cruel for me to ask you not to use that knowledge. You may share it with the other players as well, but first I’ll ask you to make the appropriate check or explain narratively why your character would know that information.

<div id="Drat">

## Profanity is a Free Action!

</div>

Conversation in combat is perfectly fine as long as you keep it in-character. Shouting strategies across the battlefield might allow the enemies to hear what you’re saying though; be careful and creative with it, maybe even speak in code or give more subtle hints. If you talk for too long you could end up spending your turn.

Whenever you’re close to crossing that line the GM will give you an appropriate warning and allow you to take your turn. Ignore the warning at your own risk.

```
```

<div id="DM-Fiat">

## DM Fiat

</div>

It’s okay to ask questions if you think the DM has fudged something important, we all have off days. At times a DM Fiat may be put in place for the purpose of the story or as a function of a homebrew ruling, but you should never be afraid to ask questions. Just try to not interrupt the flow of the game too much with questions that could better be clarified after the session.

<div id="Have-Fun">

## This is about fun

</div>

Regardless of what the rules and numbers say we are coming together to have fun—that’s the purpose of the game. If a rule or set of rules is ruining the fun by either making the game too challenging or not challenging enough we can ignore or adjust it; this is our story.

<div id="RoC">

## The Rule of Cool

</div>

If it’s awesome, it’s probably possible, especially if it’s well thought out and implemented. Rules will bend around cinematic actions at certain points, especially if it’ll make a great story at a later date, but not EVERY time something happens. It’s coolest the first time, keep that in mind.

<div id="But-But">

## But my other DM&hellip;

</div>

Chances are there will be situations that I rule on differently than DMs you have played with in the past. This is natural, as we all can see different interpretations of the rules if not fully laid out or may choose to ignore or change them for a specific purpose.

If a ruling is made and there is good reason for it, chances are it will stand, don’t lose sleep over it; just roll with it. Include this in your Application to any of my games to show that you have read these Guidelines: &ldquo;Code Zero&rdquo;.

PCs also gain an **heirloom magic item**, chosen from either: a) a list presented in [Appendix B: Heirloom Items](apx:HeirloomItems); b) a Wondrous Item chosen from either the Common or Uncommon Minor Magic Item Tables, XGtE pg. 140&mdash;141; or c) a piece of equipment made from special materials&dagger;, as presented in **Part 3: Crafting** of the [City and Wild v2.1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4jAv0Wgv9taOEJJM3I4b2VwTEU/view).</br>
* Players will start with a bonus tool proficiency, chosen from the list in the **PHB**. You will also start with this kit. This is due to using Xanathar's Guide Toolkit Rules, and should be something that can help on an adventure, such as *Cook's Utensils*, (for cooking meals), *Cartographer's Tools*, (for creating maps as you go), or *Brewer's Supplies*, (for creating potable water).

&dagger;: Aerocrystal also allows the item to be counted as finesse.

<div id="Toon-Rebuilds">

## Character Rebuilding

</div>

Following modified Adventure League Rebuilding rules, Players of levels 1-4 may, at the end of a campaign chapter, rebuild the following options of their PC. New Players joining later in the campaign, may rebuild twice with the same options presented here, up to the final chapter of the campaign.

* Character Class, including multiclass options.</br>
* Feats.</br>
* Ability Scores.</br>
* Class Archetype.</br>
* Class Features.</br>
* Spells.</br>
* Backgrounds (including bonds, features, flaws, ideals, and personality traits).</br>
* Skills.</br>
* Alignment.</br>

<div id="Alignent">

## Alignment

</div>

Alignments become a lot easier to conceptualize when you combine the answers to these two. Think of it like this, with extremely basic examples:

| Alignment (G-N-E) | = | &ldquo;I am willing to...&rdquo; |
|:--|:--:|:--|
| Good | becomes | &ldquo;I am willing to give anything...&rdquo; |
| Neutral | becomes | &ldquo;I am willing to compromise...&rdquo; |
| Evil | becomes | &ldquo;I am willing to take anything...&rdquo; |
​
| Alignment (L-N-C) | = | &ldquo;... for...&rdquo; |
|:--|:--:|:--|
| Lawful | becomes | &ldquo;... for the country.&rdquo; |
| Neutral | becomes | &ldquo;... for balance.&rdquo; |
| Chaotic | becomes | &ldquo;... for personal freedoms.&rdquo; |

You could change the examples a bit, obviously. Evil might better be elaborated as &ldquo;I am willing to make others pay the price for my goals&rdquo; versus Good's &ldquo;I will make sure no one else has to pay the price for my goals&rdquo;. Lawful might be &ldquo;for Peace&rdquo; if you really wanna shine a light on the very real concerns of &ldquo;to have security or freedom&rdquo;. And so on and so on.

Lawful would be better considered &ldquo;Collectivism&rdquo; and Chaotic would be &ldquo;Individuality&rdquo; or, strictly speaking, &ldquo;Anarchy&rdquo; in the genuine governing sense of &ldquo;people rule themselves&rdquo;.

<div id="Feats-Vuman">

## Feats and Humans

</div>

All PCs get one free feat at 1st level. PC humans are to be chosen from either [Plane Shift: Innistrad](https://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/Plane_Shift_Innistrad.pdf) or [Plane Shift: Dominaria](https://media.wizards.com/2018/downloads/magic/Plane_Shift_Dominaria.pdf), or the new subrace presented in [Humans](#Humans) in [Chapter 3: Core Races](#p8), not the PHB.

### Gift of the Ever-Living Ones

</div>

Found in **Xanathar's Guide to Everything**. *Gift of the Ever-Living Ones*'s prerequisite is changed to the following:

* **(Prerequisite: Pact of the Chain feature or a Patron given familiar.)** Takes into account **Unearthed Arcana &ndash; Warlock & Wizard**'s *The Raven Queen* patron's first level class feature *Sentinel Raven*.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

<div id="RevBlade">

### Revenant Blade

</div>

Found in **Eberron: Rising from the Last War**. Add the following as a fourth bullet point:

* When making an offhand melee attack with a double-bladed weapon, the weapon’s offhand damage die for this attack increases by one die. (Takes into account the *Whirling Blades* Fighting style).

<div id="HP-Changes">

## HP

</div>

At 1<sup>st</sup> level, you have a full Hit Dice + Constitution SCORE. From 2<sup>nd</sup> level onwards, you add your average Hit Dice + Constitution Modifier.

For example, a 3<sup>rd</sup> level ranger with a Constitution Score of 14 has a HP Total of 40. Another example: A 5<sup>th</sup> level Paladin (using the class' houseruled Hit Dice of d12) with a Constitution Score of 16 and the *Tough* feat, has a HP Total of 78.

<div id="Gear-Changes">

## Gear Changes

</div>

Normal rations cost the same, but instead weigh 1 lb, **NOT** 2 lb Make a note of this. Additional ration varieties will be added, such as the Wandermeal variety.

When you purchase a class equipment pack, you may opt to swap some items for similar ones, such as 50 ft of hemp rope for 50 ft silk rope, or 10 rations for 10 Wanderlust Rations. As these prices are of differing amounts, there are strict rules. If the original is cheaper, you pay the difference. If the replacement is cheaper, tough luck, you lose out on free money.

<div id="New-Tools-Lang-Skills">

## Learning New Tools, Languages & Skills with Downtime

</div>

Character who recieve downtime are to use the rules presented in Chapter 2 of **Xanathar's Guide to Everything**

<div id="Var-Skills">

## Variant: Skills with different abilities

</div>

As shown on page 175 of the PHB, I will be using this variant rule.

I will be using rules from Xanathar's Guide to Everything (XGtE), with regards to Tool Proficiency and their uses. I will also be using the Tying Knots rules, from the same supplement.

<div id="DMG-Mark">

## Mark

</div>

As seen on pg. 271 of the DMG, I'll be using this optional rule from the beginning of Chapter 1 of the campaign.

For those without access to the DMG, it is as follows:

*This option makes it easier for melee combatants to harry each other with opportunity attacks.*

*When a creature makes a melee attack, it can also mark its target. Until the end of the attacker's next turn, any opportunity attacks it makes against the marked target has advantage. The opportunity attack doesn't expend the attacker's reaction, but the attacker can't make the attack if anything, such as the incapacitated condition or the shocking grasp spell, is preventing it from taking reactions. The attacker is limited to one opportunity attack per turn.*

<div id="Other-House-Rules">

## Other House Rules

</div>

There is a **Charge action**. It consists of the first part of the ***Charger feat**, *&ldquo;When you use your action to Dash, you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack or to shove a creature.&rdquo;* The ***Charger*** Feat now grants a +10 feet bonus when using the **Charge Action**, as well as its second paragraph.

**Movement.** Diagonals use the 5ft-5ft-5ft rule, as it is described in the 5e PHB, and is used in Vanilla D&D4e.
<div id="Rest-Heal-Spell-Recovery">

## Resting, Healing & Spell Recovery

</div>

This variant has three rest types. They are: Rally (10 minutes, recovers all 1st level Spell Slots, recovers Constitution Score HP, cannot be used consecutively, otherwise it becomes a Short Rest), Short Rest (1 hour, recovers all 1st, 2nd and 3rd level Spell Slots, recovers abilities, traits and items that recharge on a short rest, recovers 3x Constitution Score HP, also allows spending Hit Dice), and Long Rest (8 hours, use Long Rest rules, except you recover all Hit Dice, replenish spells slots completely, recovers abilities, traits and items that recharge on a short or long rest, may only benefit from **one** long rest per in-campaign day).

This change makes combat more routine, since characters can easily recover from every battle. You might want to make combat encounters more difficult to compensate.

```
```

<div id="Healing-Spirit">

## Healing Spirit

</div>

The following text has been appended to the second paragraph: *&ldquo;The spirit can heal a number of times equal to 1 + your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of twice). After healing that number of times, the spirit disappears.&rdquo;*

<div id="Firearms-Rules-Changes">

<div class='smallerIT'>

This roleplaying game was designed by Rob Heinsoo (lead designer for D&D 4th Edition), and Jonathan Tweet, (designer for D&D 3rd and 4th Edition)

</div>

I'll be using the following rule from this RPG:

<div id="Escalation-Die">

#### Escalation Die

</div>

The escalation die represents a bonus to attacks as the fight goes on.

At the start of the second round, the GM sets the escalation die at 1. Each PC gains a bonus to attack rolls equal to the current value on the escalation die. Each round, the escalation die advances by +1, to a maximum of +6.

Monsters and NPCs do not add the escalation die bonus to their attacks

If the DM judges that the characters are avoiding conflict rather than bringing the fight to the bad guys, the escalation die doesn't advance. If combat virtually ceases, the escalation die resets to 0.

As a house rule, any individual can spend one use of a healer's kit to stabilize a companion. If you have proficiency in the Medicine skill, you gain the following benefits when using a healer's kit.

* When you use a healer's kit to stabilize an ally, that ally also regains 1 hit point.
* During a short rest, you may expend one use of a healer's kit to bind wounds, offer pain-numbing salves, and apply natural anticoagulants. The target heals 1d6+4 hit points of damage. The target also gains hit points equal to its number of hit dice.

<div id="Crit-Role-Camp-Book-1">

### Tal'dorei Campaign Setting Rules

</div>

<div class='smallerIT'>

A sourcebook for D&D 5e, created by Matt Mercer, of Critical Role fame.

</div>

As seen in the [Tal'dorei Campaign Setting Guide](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/216849/Critical-Role-TalDorei-Campaign-Setting), the following rules are in place for this campaign:

* **Rapid Quaffing:** The time required to pull free and quaff a potion is changed from one action to one bonus action. This enables many classes, especially more melee/combat focused classes, the ability to down a healing potion or enhancing liquid without sacrificing their entire round of attacks. Administering a potion to an unconscious character would still require an action. Don't forget: enemies can also drink their potions as quickly!
* In this campaign, alternative resurrection rules are being used. See Resurrection Rules.
* **Intimidating Presence *(Barbarian Ability)*** is based on Strength and Charisma.
* The *Wall of Stone* spell is instantaneous and permanent, not concentration with a duration.

<div id="Resurrection-Rules">

#### Didn't Come Back Right &mdash; Alternative Resurrection Rules

</div>

Within this rule, the process of dying and being pulled back into your body is a harrowing experience. The magic itself pulls you from beyond the dark veil of death, taking its toll on your body and psyche each time, leaving you less and less the person you were.

When a character is brought back to life via magic, that character must make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to 20 &ndash; the level of the magic used to return the character to life. A failure on this check inflicts long term madness (see *DMG*, p. 260), except that the duration is measured in days rather than hours. A *lesser restoration* or *remove curse* will alleviate the madness itself, though it returns any time that character drops to 0 hit points or awakens from sleep, until its full duration has expired.

</div>

<div id="Better-Crits">

#### Better Critical Hits

</div>

With this variant, critical hits are more lethal. Instead of simply dealing double the dice of damage, critical hits deal maximum damage plus an additional dice of damage. For example, a longsword attack that deals 1d8+5 damage would deal 1d8+13 on a critical hit.

The benefit to this variant is that critical hits become much more effective and faster during gameplay. This is nice because as written there are times when a critical hit could equate to simply one more point of damage, which is neither impressive, fun nor cinematic. This does make combat a little more lethal though and especially at low level. If you want a more gritty or epic game, consider this variant.

<div id="Var-Magic-Heal">

#### Variant Magical Healing

</div>

Your curative spells always heal their average die roll (rounded up). For example, a 1st level cure wounds spell heals 5 hit points per die. No one likes getting 1's on the cure critical wounds when the chips are down.

# Chapter 3 &ndash; Core Races Changes

The races found in the Players Handbook are available for PCs. Races mentioned in this chapter have either changes or additions to them. In the case of changes, players must use the version presented here.

The following races are modified from their official presentation. They are Dragonborn, Elves, Half-elves, Air and Earth Genasi, Goliath, Kenku, Revenant, Tabaxi, and Tiefling. Other races are found in Gaia. They are detailed in the sources listed in New Races.

<div id="Dragonborn">

## Dragonborn

</div>

<div id="Dragonborn-Traits">

### Dragonborn Traits

</div>

Your draconic heritage manifests in a variety of traits you share with other dragonborn.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your choice of either Strength or Dexteritiy score increases by 2.

**Age.** Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10 year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.

**Alignment.** Dragonborn are usually lawful but tend to extremes of morality, making a conscious choice for one side or the other in the cosmic war between good and evil.

**Size.** Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Draconic Ancestry.** Choose one type of dragon from the Draconic Ancestry table, which influences your other racial features as shown. If a racial feature requires a saving throw, the DC is (8 + your Charisma or Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus).

<div class='classTable smallerRE' id="Dragonborn-SubRaces">

| **Dragon** | **Damage Type** | **Lair Heritage** | **Breath Shape (Save)** |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Black | Acid | Amphibious | Line (Dexterity) |
| Blue | Lightning | Darkvision | Line (Dexterity) |
| Brass | Fire | Darkvision | Line (Dexterity) |
| Bronze | Lightning | Amphibious | Line (Dexterity) |
| Copper | Acid | High-Dweller | Line (Dexterity) |
| Gold | Fire | Amphibious | Cone (Dexterity) |
| Green | Poison | Amphibious | Cone (Constitution) |
| Red | Fire | High-Dweller | Cone (Dexterity) |
| Silver | Cold | High-Dweller | Cone (Constitution) |
| White | Cold | Darkvision | Cone (Constitution) |

</div>

**Draconic Resistance.** You have resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry.

**Lair Heritage.** You have the feature associated with your draconic ancestry:

* *Amphibious.* You can breathe both air and water, and gain a swimming speed of 30 feet.
* *Darkvision.* You can see in dim light as if it were bright light out to 60 feet, and in darkness as if it were dim light.
* *High-Dweller.* You gain proficiency in the Athletics skill, and a climbing speed of 30 feet.

**Natural Armor.** A Dragonborn's Natural Armor grants an Unarmored AC of 13 + Dexterity Modifier. Page two of the [Sage Advice Compendium](https://media.wizards.com/2020/dnd/downloads/SA-Compendium.pdf) goes into rulings on how AC is calculated. Treat this Natural Armor as a **Racial** Draconic Resilience, for intents and purposes.

**Ore-breaker Claws.** Your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the normal bludgeoning damage for an unarmed strike. Additionally, you can use your claws as a tool for the purpose of harvesting ore and digging.

&emsp;&emsp;**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic.

**Subrace.** The draconic blood of the dragonborn expresses itself in a number of ways. Choose one of these subraces.

<div id="Elemental-Dragonborn">

### Elemental Dragonborn

</div>

You have developed the famed elemental breath of the dragons. Often, such dragonborn bear throat-wattles or colored crests, or crackle with primordial power.

**Dragon Breath.** You can use an bonus action to exhale energy in the form of a 20 foot cone, or a 5 foot wide and 40 feet long line. Every creature in this area makes a saving throw.

A creature takes 3d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on success. The damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (4d6), 11th level (5d6), and 17th level (6d6).

Your draconic ancestry determines the shape, damage type, and saving throw of your breath weapon. You may use your Dragon Breath per short</br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;rest equal to once at 1<sup>st</sup>, twice from 2<sup>nd</sup>, three times from 11<sup>th</sup>,</br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and four times from 17<sup>th</sup>.

```
```

<div id="Fear-Dragonborn">

### Fearsome Dragonborn

</div>

You carry within yourself the terrible presence of the dragons, to be unleashed in a dreadful outcry. Such dragonborn are often horned, or have eyes that burn with ancient might.

**Dragon Fear.** You can use a bonus action on your turn to unleash a draconic roar, forcing each creature of your choice that can see or hear you within 30 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw.

Each creature that fails this save becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. A victim can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself if it succeeds.

You may use your Dragon Fear per short rest equal to once at 1<sup>nd</sup>, twice from 2<sup>nd</sup>, three times from 11<sup>th</sup>, and four times from 17<sup>th</sup>.

<div id="Shadow-Dragonborn">

### Shadow Dragonborn

</div>

**Ability Score Increase.** Your time in the Plane of Shadows has fundamentally changed you. Instead of the default Ability Score Increase, your Constitution increases by 2, and your Strength increases by 1.

**Size.** Due to their links with the Plane of Shadow, shadow dragonborn weigh less on average than other types of dragonborn.

**Superior Darkvision.** You can see in darkness up to 120ft, you can see in low light conditions as if it were bright light and darkness as if it were dim light. You cannot discern colour in the darkness, just shades of grey.

**Umbral Cloaked.** You have advantage on Stealth Checks made to hide in shadowy areas.

**Shadow Breath.** You have a breath attack as per the above dragonborn, but it deals necrotic damage instead of the damage associated with the draconic ancestry. You also have resistance to necrotic damage.

**Shadeborn.** You are immune to Shadowfell despair, the despair of Hades, and other similar effects.

<div id="Elves-Half-Elves">

## Elves, and Half-elves

</div>

Elf Weapon Training: Elves have additional proficiency with Elven Curve Blades, Elven Double Bows and Greatbows.

Half-elves gain the same Elf Weapon Training as Elves do, as modified by this guide.

Humans are a varied race. The PHB Human and Variant Humans are banned. Players wishing to play a human are required to choose one from [Plane Shift: Innistrad](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/228654/Plane-Shift-Innistrad), [Plane Shift: Dominaria](https://media.wizards.com/2018/downloads/magic/Plane_Shift_Dominaria.pdf), or the following subrace.

* **Whisper on the Breeze.** You can subtly guide the wind currents to better eavesdrop on distant or whispered words. You gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) rolls to understand voices you can hear as long as air can freely flow between you and the speakers.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

\page

<div id="Genasi-Earth">

### Earth Genasi

</div>

* **Merge with Stone.** You know the *mold earth* (EE) cantrip.

<div id="Goliath">

## Goliath

</div>

Players wishing to play a Goliath must use the one presented in [Volo's Complete Subrace Handbook](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/230470/Volos-Complete-Subrace-Handbook-Over-50-Subraces), on pages 14 &mdash; 17, but add the following:

* **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 35 feet.
* **Giant's Grip.** You may wield weapons with the Buster property without the inherent disadvantage.
* **Half-Giant Vigor.** Your hit point maximum increases by 4, and it increases by 4 every time you gain a level.

***Stoneborn Goliath's*** *Boulder Toss* doubles it's thrown range at 11<sup>th</sup>. and increases it's damage according to the following table.

| Initial Damage | 5<sup>th leve | 11<sup>th</sup> level | 17<sup>th</sup> level |

<div id="Kenku-Tengu">

## Kenku / Tengu

</div>

Kenku do not exist in my campaign. Instead, you may use their traits, with the following modifications, to play as Tengu, which are unburdened by the curse of the Unknown Master.

* **Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity and Wisdom scores each increase by 2.
* **Age.** Tengu mature faster, yet have longer lifespans than humans. They reach maturity at about 10 years old and can live to 160.
* **Speed.** 40ft.

The Save DC for this Saving Throw is 10 + half the damage dice incurred. For example, if the Tabaxi falls enough to incur 20d6 damage, the DC is 20 (10 + 20/2). If they fail, they instead take 10d6 damage.

You gain no benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you apply its bonus as normal.

<div id="Cait-Sith">

## Cait Sith

</div>

*These mysterious beings tend to flock around humans, closer to man than beast. They communicate via their Mognet communications network, and their distinctive cry of &ldquo;Kupo!&rdquo; and fluffy appearance endear them to all.*

Cait Sith are a pair of family clans, that work together to restore their heritage via their separate means. The Pooka are the Warrior clan, whereas the Moogle are the Support clan. Pooka make nimble Fighters, Rogues or Rangers, whereas Moogle generally become Engineers, as they are able to deftly evade the explosions of their mishaps.

<div id="Cait-Sith-Traits">

### Traits

</div>

* **Ability modifiers.** Your Dexterity Score increases by 2, and your Charisma Score increases by 1.
* **Age.** A Cait Sith reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally lives into the middle of his or her second century.
* **Alignment.** Most Cait Sith are lawful good. As a rule, they are good-hearted and kind, hate to see others in pain, and have no tolerance for oppression. They are also very orderly and traditional, leaning heavily on the support of their community and the comfort of their old ways.
* **Size.** Cait Sith average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.
* **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.
* **Lucky.** When you roll a 1 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.
* **Brave.** You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.
* **Cait Sith Nimbleness.** You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.

```
```

* **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Cait. The Cait language isn't secret, but Cait Sith are loath to share it with others. They write very little, so they don't have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all Cait Sith speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling.

The two main kinds of Cait Sith, Pooka and Moogle, are more like closely related families than true sub-races. Choose one of these sub-races.

<div id="Burmecian">

## Burmecian

</div>

The Burmecian's are a fairly middle aged race of humanoid rat people whom had found their callings in the art of warfare. Having found solace in the fun and entertainment of combat, the noble Burmecian's preferred to play with their opponents during combat.

Many whom have found a battle ground opposite of these agile fighters live to speak of their entrancing flirtatious attitudes that would glow brighter as the heat of combat grew tense. It was enough to garner victory out of the pure confusion or rage that it would bring out of their opponents.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

\page

**Physical Appearance.** A Burmecian is most typically an anthropomorphic rat like bipedal humanoid. They bare a rat like face with some human qualities, hair, full body fur (typically either grey, white or light brown), clawed feet and functional humanoid hands with functional thumbs.

<div id="Burmecian-SubRaces">

<div id="Burmecian-Burm">

#### Burm

</div>

The Burms, or simply the Burmecian's who had remained infatuated with their combat ideals. They are some of the most playful fighters the realm has seen; brandishing smiles and a powerfully charming flirtatious attitude when engaged in combat.

<div id="Mul">

## Mul

</div>

Muls are half-dwarves, descended from the union of a human and a dwarf. They have the stature, agility, and mental flexibility of humankind, coupled with the physical resilience and endurance of dwarves, a rare combination of qualities that makes Muls more than a simple blend of the two races.

Because they are strong, tough, quick, and blessed with fantastic endurance, Muls are highly prized as slaves. In fact, most Muls are born into slavery.

<div id="Mul-Traits">

### Traits

</div>

Mul share a few common traits with one another.


* **Ability modifiers.** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 2.
* **Age.** Mul age at the same rate as humans but live up to 130 years and suffer few ill effects of old age.

```
```

* **Alignment.** Mul are as variable in their attitudes to the world as their parentage but nonetheless tend towards lawful alignments.

* **Languages.** Muls can read, write and understand Common and Dwarven.

<div id="Selkies">

## Selkies

</div>

Selkies are a nomadic people who value independence, self-reliance, and freedom above all else. They have the least amount of group cohesion of all races in the world. Their frequently selfish behavior has caused them to be looked down upon with scorn and mistrust.

Discrimination has forced many of them to make their living as thieves, and they typically end up as criminals. Selkies are some of the less common kinds of people in the world today, their numbers far lower than other major races. Clearly they must have enough capabilities about them to persist to the present day.

**Physical Appearance.** The Selkies are a swift and acrobatic race that shares many physical similarities with half-elves. Selkie males and females have long hair and more lithe forms than humans or elves. Skin tone also varies widely, though many who hail from the deserts are darker toned than most humans.

While most races can tell apart similar-looking humans and Selkies through subtle cues, it's not unheard of for them to be confused. Selkies are said to &ldquo;have a wild look&rdquo; and a slightly taller posture compared to that of a human. A member of either race disguising as the other isn't especially difficult, unlike attempts at disguising as, say, a Halfling or a Moogle.

**Society and Culture.** Selkies do not have a good reputation among the other races. Many Selkies tend to be selfish and impatient, resorting to thievery rather than other jobs. Selkies gravitate towards professions that require lots of movement and activity.

Selkies have an extremely rich culture that is little known to outsiders from other races. Rituals and traditions are passed on from generation to generation through their large, typically nomadic families. Even mystic scholars cannot easily decipher Selkie history and culture, passed down through Selkic speech and selkic script.

<div id="Selkies-Common-Names">

### Common Selkie Names

</div>

**Female.** Roo Jay, Ra Lena, Momo Phi, Tiy Rah, Sala Nah, See Sooy

**Male.** Muh Jica, Dah Maat, Giy Em, Gul Toh, De Di, Geck Moo

<div id="Selkies-Traits">

### Traits

</div>

The agile Selkie tribe can understand animals in ways that other races can't. Perhaps the most unique aspect of the Selkies is their natural language. At about four years of age, all Selkies innately understand selkic script.

Oddly enough, this language seems to alter slightly from generation to generation, making it almost impossible for non-Selkies to translate it. Selkies from new and old generations alike are somehow able to perfectly understand the language no matter from what generation it is from. Some Selkies are unaware that there even is a generational change in selkic script and speech.


* **Ability modifiers.** Your Dexterity Score increases by 2.
* **Age.** Selkies live an average of 95 years.
* **Alignment.** Selkies lack a respect for law outside of the family and are thus more likely than other races to be chaotic.
* **Size.** Selkies stand at an average of 5&frac12;&mdash;6 feet and average about 135 pounds. Your size is Medium.
* **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 35 feet.
* **Animal Commune.** In tune with nature, Selkies can communicate basic ideas with animals.
* **Keen senses.** You have proficiency in the Perception skill.
* **Mask of the Wild.** You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

\page

* **Selkie Weapon Training.** You gain proficiency with the scimitar, double scimitar, longbow, and shortbow.
* **Languages.** Selkies can read, write and understand Common and Selkic (Variant: One Exotic Language). See next trait.
* **Selkish Script.** You understand and speak selkic, a special language learned innately at birth. The language can be written and spoken. Only Selkies can understand selkic.

<div id="Selkies-SubRaces">

### Sub-races

</div>

Selkies come from a variety of nomadic tribes, though some now reside in the kingdoms of other races.

<div id="Selkies-Nomad">

#### Lynarian Nomads

</div>

You can trace your family line to the Lynari Desert, and you've inherited your ancestors' conditioning and resistance to harsh environments.


* **Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 1.
* **Desert Walker.** You are naturally adapted to hot climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. You also have proficiency in the Survival skill.

<div id="Selkies-City">

* **Ability Score Increase.** Your Charisma score increases by 1.
* **Street Smart.** You're experienced in influencing people with subtle tricks. Once per long rest you may apply advantage to any deception, persuasion, intimidation or other Charisma-based ability check. You also have proficiency in the Stealth skill.

<div id="Vryloka">

## Vryloka

</div>

<div id="Vryloka-Origins">

### Crimson Origins

</div>

Vrylokas are the result of a dark ritual generations ago that transformed human nobles into living vampires. The identity and goals of the ritual’s creator, a wizard known only as the Red Witch, have remained a mystery. The ritual provided the nobles with inhuman vitality and a literal thirst for life without the curse of true undeath. Many years later, these powerful, emotional beings walk the halls of power throughout the land, secretly posing as eccentric human aristocrats from distant kingdoms. To stave off the occasional boredom of their long lives, many Vrylokas meet in the shadows to plot for power, while others become adventurers. A bold few – simultaneously fascinated and repulsed by their occult origins – even become vampire hunters.

<div id="Vryloka-Allure">

### Alluring and Passionate

</div>

Vrylokas have dark gray or blue eyes that turn red when they are angered or excited. Their skin is uniformly pale, ranging from pinkish flesh to chalky white. Most Vrylokas have hair in shades of red, from deep scarlet to strawberry blond. They possess a beguiling charm, with the females shapely and statuesque and the males tall and imposing. They tend to feel all emotions strongly, whether they’re possessively pursuing a romantic interest or reacting with fury to a perceived slight.

<div id="Vryloka-Secrets">

### A Life of Secrets

</div>

Key to a Vryloka's longevity is concealment of their vampiric heritage. They take great care to pass as human whenever possible, and they may change residences and identities to avoid questions about their lack of aging. In addition to keeping secrets, they’ve uncovered many secrets of others, thanks to their long lives and access to the halls of power. Many Vrylokas possess historical knowledge denied to all but the most learned sages.

<div id="Vryloka-Common-Names">

### Common Vryloka Names

</div>

As human nobles.

<div id="Vryloka-Traits">

### Traits

</div>

* **Ability modifiers.** Your Charisma score increases by 2 and your Dexterity score increases by 1.
* **Age.** Vrylokas mature at the same rate as humans, but the aging process slowly considerably once they reach adulthood, and they retain their vitality until their dying days. A Vryloka can typically live to be 350 years old.
* **Alignment.** Most Vrylokas are lawful, with a strong sense of tradition and rules, which are necessary to preserve a Vryloka's secrets and continued existence. They show no predilection for good or evil, although a Vryloka commonly displays a superior attitude regardless of alignment.
* **Size.** Vryloka stand at an average of 5&frac12;&mdash;6 feet and average about 135 pounds. Your size is Medium.
* **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 40 feet.
* **Darkvision.** The taint of vampirism provides superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
* **Human Heritage.** You have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks to pass as human.
* **Bloodsurge.** When a Vryloka reduces an enemy creature to 0 hit points, it can use its Reaction to acquire one of the following benefits; Dash towards the nearest enemy in sight, heal missing hit points equal to one-half your level plus your Charisma modifier, or gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls until the end of its next turn.
* **Living Dead.** Because your soul is tainted by undeath, you are both living and undead. If an ability or spell has different effects on living creatures and undead creatures, you choose which effect applies to you.
* **Necrotic Resistance.** You have resistance against necrotic damage.
* **Red Ledger.** You have proficiency in the History skill.
* **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Vrylokas who seek to leverage their arcane ancestry learn Draconic, while the more martially inclined often learn the language of an hostile race or group.

<div id="CommSet">

### Comm Set

</div>

A communicator carries audio and visual signals, and includes a built-in camera that can record all communications being broadcast. Communication between two communicators requires both users to tune their individual devices to the same frequency.

Ninjas, who are specially trained to use these weapons, never suffer disadvantage due to range.

* **Flashpowder.** A flashpowder grenade is effective only when thrown into a fire source, where it explodes in a brilliant flash of light.  Any creature within 10 feet must make a successful Constitution save (DC 10) or be blinded for 1 minute.  There is no effect if the grenade misses the fire (though the grenade is ruined). **Cost.** 60 gp.
* **Pepper.** A pepper grenade that hits its target directly incapacitates the target for 1 round unless it makes a successful Constitution save (DC 10). There is no &ldqou;splash&rdqou; effect. **Cost.** 10 gp.
* **Poison Smoke.** A poison smoke grenade is a modified smoke grenade that bursts into a cloud of vile, stinking smoke.  The poison</br>&emsp;&emsp;smoke may be tainted with any poison with the inhale key</br>&emsp;&emsp;word (DMG pg. 257). **Cost.** 150 gp.
* **Smoke.** A Smoke grenade emits a cloud of smoke that creates a heavily obscured area in a 10-foot radius. A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the smoke in 4 rounds; a strong wind (20 or more miles per hour) disperses it in 1 round. **Cost.** 20 gp.

Several windows allow those inside to see outside. The interior contains several fluorescent lights. The shelter can withstand winds of up to 120 mph, and provides excellent insulation for those inside, maintaining a temperature of about 70&#176; Fahrenheit. A small combination heater/air scrubber set on the floor near the entrance to the shelter controls the temperature and purifies any noxious external air into breathable air.

The hut has fire resistance, cold resistance, and acid resistance. The dense plastic walls have AC 15 and 30 hit points. The hut cannot float on water. The door is self-sealing, allowing anyone inside an emergency shelter to live in inhospitable conditions with ease for as long as the power holds out. As long as no foreign objects or creatures remain inside an emergency shelter, it can be commanded at the touch of a button to compact back down into its portable shape over the course of 1 minute. After this point, the device consumes 1 charge over the course of 8 hours resetting its internal structure, limiting its deployment to 3 times a day at most.

It has 12 charges, and restores all charges after spending 8 consecutive hours in direct sunlight, in either of its forms.

## APPENDIX A: DMG Rules

</div>

<div id="Appx-A-Renown">

### Renown

</div>

Renown is an optional rule you can use to track an adventurer's standing within a faction or organization. Renown is a numerical value that starts at 0, then increases as a character earns favor and reputation within an organization. You can tie benefits to a character's renown, including ranks and titles within the organization and access to resources.

A player tracks renown separately for each organization his or her character is a member of. For example, an adventurer might have 5 renown within one faction and 20 renown within another, based on the character's interaction with each organization over the course of the campaign.

<div id="Appx-A-Gaining-Renown">

### Gaining Renown

</div>

A character earns renown by completing missions or quests that serve an organization's interests or involve the organization directly. You award renown at your discretion as characters complete these missions or quests, typically at the same time you award experience points.

Advancing an organization's interests increases a character's renown within that organization by 1. Completing a mission specifically assigned by that organization, or which directly benefits the organization, increases the character's renown by 2 instead.

For example, characters with connections to the noble Order of the Gauntlet complete a mission in which they free a town from the tyranny of a blue dragon.
Because the order likes to punish evildoers, you might increase each character's renown within the order by 1. Conversely, if killing the dragon was a mission given to the adventurers by a senior member of the order, completing the task might instead increase each character's renown by 2, showing the adventurers as effective allies.

Meanwhile, the party's rogue might have looted a box of rare poisons from the dragon's hoard and sold it to a fence who is secretly a Zhentarim agent. You might increase the rogue's renown within the Zhentarim by 2 since this action directly increased that group's power and wealth, even though the task was not assigned by an agent of the Zhentarim.

<div id="Appx-A-Renown-Benefits">

### Benefits of Renown

</div>

The benefits of increasing renown within an organization can include rank and authority, friendly attitudes from members of the organization, and other perks.

**Rank.** Characters can earn promotions as their renown increases. You can establish certain thresholds of renown that serve as prerequisites (though not
necessarily the only prerequisites) for advancing in rank, as shown in the Examples of Faction Ranks table.

For example, a character might join the Lords' Alliance after earning 1 renown within that organization, gaining the title of cloak. As the character's renown within the organization increases, he or she might be eligible for further increases in rank.

You can add rank prerequisites. For example, a character affiliated with the Lords' Alliance might have to be at least 5th level before becoming a stingblade, at least 10th level to be a warduke, and at least 15th level to be a lioncrown.

You can set these thresholds of renown to any numbers that work for your game, creating appropriate ranks and titles for the organizations in your campaign.

<div id="Appx-A-Org-Attitude">

### Attitudes of Organization Members

</div>

As a character's renown within an organization grows, members of that organization are increasingly likely to have heard of the character. You can set thresholds at which the default attitude of an organization's members toward the character becomes indifferent or friendly.

For example, members of the Emerald Enclave &ndash; a faction dedicated to preserving the natural order &ndash; might be less friendly toward characters who have not cultivated at least 3 renown within that organization, becoming friendly by default only when a character has gained 10 renown within the Emerald Enclave.

These thresholds apply only to the default attitude of most members of an organization, and such attitudes aren't automatic. NPC faction members might dislike an adventurer despite that character's renown &ndash; or perhaps because of it.

```
```

<div id="Appx-A-Renown-Perks">

### Perks

</div>

Earning a rank within an organization comes with certain benefits, as defined by you. A character of low rank might gain access to a reliable contact and adventure leads, a safe house, or a trader willing to offer a discount on adventuring gear. A middle-ranked character might gain a follower (see chapter 4, &ldquo;Creating Nonplayer Characters&rdquo;, access to potions and scrolls, the ability to call in a favor, or backup on dangerous missions. A high-ranking character might be able to call on a small army, take custody of a rare magic item, gain access to a helpful spellcaster, or assign special missions to members of lower rank.

<div id="Appx-A-Renown-Downtime-Activities">

### Downtime Activities

</div>

You might allow characters to spend downtime between adventures building relationships and gaining renown within an organization. For more information on downtime activities, see chapter 6, &ldquo;Between Adventures.&rdquo;

<div id="Appx-A-Losing-Renown">

### Losing Renown

</div>

Disagreements with members of an organization aren't enough to cause a loss of renown within that organization. However, serious offenses committed against the organization or its members can result in a loss of renown and rank within the organization.

The extent of the loss depends on the infraction and is left to your discretion. A character's renown within an organization can never drop below 0.

<div id="Appx-A-Gaining-Renown-Downtime">

### Gaining Renown During Downtime

</div>

A character can spend downtime improving his or her renown within an organization (see &ldquo;Renown&rdquo; in DMG chapter 1). Between adventures, a character undertakes minor tasks for the organization and socializes with its members. After pursuing these activities for a combined number of days equal to his or her current renown multiplied by 10, the character's renown increases by 1.

<div id="Appx-B">

## APPENDIX B: Heirloom Items

</div>

<div id="Appx-B-Arrow-Detect">

### Arrow of Detection

</div>

Up to seven times per week, you can use an action to toss the arrow into the air and name a creature, object, or place. This can be as specific as ``the goblin king Guk-luk'' or as general as ``the nearest tavern''. The arrow briefly hovers in the air, pointing toward the target, then returns to your hand.

<div id="Appx-B-Elven-Boots">

### Boots of Elvenkind

</div>

While you wear these boots, your steps make no sound, regardless of the surface you are moving across. You also have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on moving silently.

<div id="Appx-B-Luckstone">

### Luckstone

</div>

While this polished agate is on your person, you gain a +1 bonus to ability checks and saving throws.
