# Iomandra
___
The world of Iomandra is named after Io, the creator of dragons. The word “Iomandra” is Draconic; it means “Io’s trove” or “world of Io.”
___

According to legend, Io consorted with primordial beings to create Iomandra as a playground for dragons. Other gods flattered Io with praise for his design even as they were crafting worlds of their own, improving on his work. Io studied with envy the works of his divine peers, took note of the various humanoid races they’d created, and decided that his world needed such creatures to serve and amuse his dragons. Io negotiated with his fellow gods to bring humans, eladrin, elves, dwarves, halflings, and other races to the world—but none of them felt quite right to him. With the help of his children, Io crafted a humanoid race modeled after dragonkind and called them the dragonborn. The dragonborn were given every advantage, and with the help of the dragons they conquered and enslaved Iomandra’s other sentient humanoid races. The humans of Iomandra proved the most difficult to enslave; one kingdom in particular forged infernal pacts with devils in return for great power, thus birthing the tiefling race. However, even such desperate measures could not protect them from the awesome might of the dragonborn and their dragon masters. Their empires stretched across the vast continents of the world.
____

The covetous dragonborn empires eventually turned on one another. Petty rivalries and territorial disputes led to wars and horrible bloodshed. At the same time, slave revolts threatened to break the dynasties’ hold over the “lesser” races of Iomandra. To maintain order and restore paradise, Io sent his godling children to rule the great continents on his behalf, but they too became corrupt and tried to usurp each other’s power. Three of Io’s children perished in this world-shaking feud. Furious, Io recalled to the heavens his two surviving children—Bahamut and Tiamat—and unleashed a maelstrom that would sink the continents of Iomandra beneath the sea. Not everything was destroyed, however. In defiance of their father, Bahamut and Tiamat intervened and prevented the lands from sinking completely. Their intervention created islands around the globe where the world’s remaining inhabitants could survive and prosper. Moved by his children’s demonstration of unity, Io left the world in their custody. However, Bahamut and Tiamat would never again see eye to eye, and to this day, each seeks to break the other’s influence.
____

Iomandra of the “modern day” is a watery world peppered with islands of every size and ecosystem. Some of these islands are hundreds of miles across; others are barely large enough to support a single structure. Trade links many of the “civilized” islands, but countless more have yet to be explored. Beneath the waves lie the remnants of ancient, sunken empires and the treasures of the ages. In this, the modern day, scores of vessels ply the Dragon Sea. They include heavily laden merchant ships, well-armed warships, swift privateer vessels, and fleets of marauding pirates.

 An intricate net of trade routes link the civilized islands, and ships that stray from these routes do so at their own risk. The only surviving nation of consequence is Arkhosia, ruled by a decadent and corrupt dragonborn dynasty that reveres Bahamut and Tiamat, fears Io’s wrath, and regards true dragons as divine exarchs.

<div style='margin-top:290px'></div>

<img

  style='position:absolute; top:195px; right:30px; width:370px' />



The humans, elves, dwarves, halflings, tieflings, and other “civilized races” that inhabit Iomandra are no longer bound by draconic law. Having long since freed themselves from the bonds of slavery, they have charted their own destinies and spread across the world. These descendants of the ancient slave races bear no animosity to modern-day dragonborn, most of whom regard slavery as abhorrent under the teachings of Bahamut. Ever since Emperor Azunkhan III of the Dragovar openly professed his belief in “other gods,” these civilized races have expanded the pantheon of true gods to include such reverent figures as Erathis (goddess of civilization) and Melora (goddess of the sea).

## THE DRACONIC ISLES
____


The Draconic Isles is the singular name given to the thousands of islands that dot the surface of Iomandra. And they are called the Draconic Isles for good reason.

By ancient law, all land belongs to the scions of Io—the true dragons. This was true when Iomandra had vast continents; it is still true now. When a dragon reaches adult age, it is expected to leave its nest and claim an island of its own. A weak dragon might find a small, uncontested island to rule. An elder dragon or ancient wyrm will seek to rule the largest island it can find, preferably one with abundant food supplies. Not every island of Iomandra has a dragon overlord. Some islands are simply too small or wretched. Others are hotly contested. Others still haven’t been claimed because no dragon has found them yet.

When a dragon takes ownership of an island, it expects all of the island’s other inhabitants to pay it tribute. Those who do not comply are devoured or driven off. Most sensible creatures acknowledge the dragon’s status and may even stand to benefit from the dragon’s protection (depending on its disposition). An island always adopts the name of the dragon that lives there; when a dragon overlord changes, so too does the island’s name . . . much to the chagrin of the world’s foremost cartographers.

Nothing is more precious to a dragon than its island dominion. A dragon that cannot find an island to rule will do anything to wrest control of one. Dragons who rule islands must therefore be wary of rivals. Their lairs are often trapped or guarded, and they are smart enough to use minions or adventurers to eliminate likely challengers.

It’s worth noting that over the course of history, many influential dragonborn warlords and emperors have claimed to be scions of Io, but the true dragons of the world have never acknowledged such claims. In one notable case, an ancient gold dragon named Mazuzura openly refuted such a bold claim made by Emperor Azunkhan V of the Dragovar by attacking his palace in broad daylight and devouring him. Today, the Dragovar Dynasty spans dozens of major islands, all with powerful dragon overlords. These mighty dragons horribly tax the coffers of the Dragovar, but they also provide the greatest protection that gold can buy.

<div style='margin-top:340px'></div>



### ARKHOSIA
Arkhosia was once the name of Iomandra’s largest continent. All that remains of Arkhosia today is a vast chain of mostly populated islands under the control of the Dragovar dynasty. There aren’t enough Dragovar soldiers or warships to protect all of the nation’s islands, and many of the outlying islands are left to fend for themselves.

The surviving nation of Arkhosia is home to many races, not just the dragonborn. These races strive to coexist peacefully under difficult circumstances. Arkhosian settlements are often crowded and cramped because of the limited land. As a point of fact, all Arkhosian land belongs to the Dragovar royal family, and the standard punishment for anyone who breaks the law or defies a royal decree is torture, branding, and exile. Exiled citizens are forbidden to set foot on Arkhosian soil, on penalty of death.

The royal family appoints magistrates to govern their islands—one magistrate per island. Magistrates serve for life, and magistrates who perform their duties poorly often meet a terrible end. A magistrate is responsible for enforcing imperial law, keeping an accurate census, paying off the island’s dragon overlord, taxing the locals, and ensuring that tax money is delivered safely to the royal coffers in the Dragovar capital of Io’calioth. Because Dragovar soldiers are spread so thin, magistrates often resort to using mercenaries and cutthroats to fulfill their obligations to the imperial throne.



#### Dragonborn Castes
A dragonborn citizen of Arkhosia is born into one of six castes: noble, divine, martial, arcane, expert, or commoner. A seventh caste—the slave caste—was officially abolished in 345 DY. A dragonborn can petition to join another caste, but it’s expensive (5,000 gp) and requires the written approval of an imperial vizier or magistrate. Each caste is described below:
___
##### Noble Caste
Dragonborn of the noble caste enjoy great privilege and prestige, and they are allowed to stay with their families and retain their family names. Dragonborn nobles live in luxury, leaving the day-to-day chores and business to others. A few ambitious nobles become politicians, magistrates, or viziers.

  style='position:absolute; top:665px; right:0px; width:820px' />


<div class='pageNumber'>4</div>

\page
##### Divine Caste 
Dragonborn of the divine caste are taken from their homes at age 3, raised by priests in a temple, and forbidden to keep their family names. The temples of Bahamut and Tiamat are strongly favored, although the churches of Bane, Erathis, Pelor, and Melora are growing in favor and popularity. Before becoming a cleric, a dragonborn must pass a test of devotion, as determined by the high priest of the temple. Ambitious embers of the divine caste gifted with a flair for politics and diplomacy often seek to become imperial viziers and grand viziers—the keepers of doctrine in the Dragovar empire.

##### Martial Caste
Initiates of the martial caste are taken from their homes at age 3, stripped of their family names, and subjected to twelve years of basic martial training followed by three years of gladiator training. Many dragonborn do not survive the training, let alone the gladiatorial trials-by-combat. Those who survive become soldiers of the empire. Within the martial caste are elite sects that serve specific military functions, including the Vost Miraj (a sect of rogues that specializes in espionage) and Khygar's Brood (a much-feared military police force within the capital, named after its leader, Colonel Khygar).
___
##### Arcane Caste
Dragonborn of the arcane caste are separated from their families at age 3, stripped of their family names, and assigned to Arkhosian mages as pupils. After several years of study and magical testing, they become apprentices. The exact number of years depends on the ability of the individual, but the average period of study is twelve years. Apprentices are pitted against one another in arcane duels; those who prevail become wizards, warlocks, and sorcerers in the service of the empire. Within the arcane caste are elite sects that specialize in particular fields of magical study (for example, the Shan Qabal and the Jhal Shard), but very few members of the caste actually belong to them.

<img

  style='position:absolute; top:630px; right:410px; width:370px' />

<div style='margin-top:380px'></div>

##### Expert Caste
Members of the expert caste are taken from their homes at age 3 and assigned to master artisans as resident apprentices. During their apprenticeship, they are not denied access to their families or stripped of their family names. After twelve years of study and service, if they receive their master’s blessing, they are entitled to pursue their skill independently and take on apprentices of their own. A dragonborn of the expert caste who fails her master may pursue another profession.
  
##### Commoner Caste
Commoners are not entitled to special training and cannot become soldiers, spellcasters, or artisans. Their options are usually limited to family-run businesses and menial labor.

### MYRTHON REGENCY
The Myrthon Regency is a vassal state of
the imperial commonwealth. Located west of Sanghor, the islands were exploited for their rich concentration of cold iron, also known as meteorite iron.
The marriage of the Arkhosian and Myrthon dynasties gave rise to the Dragovar empire, although tensions between the royal lines never fully abated. After decades of complacency, the Myrthon Regency is itching for independence, forcing Io'calioth to send fleets of Dragovar warships westward to confront the Myrthon and make their Regent, Tsar Dakor, fall in line. Tsar Dakur is an intellectual ruler who holds a fascination with the stars.

 
### THE EYE OF IO
Despite its vastness, the Dragon Sea is surprisingly calm. Storms happen rarely, ensuring safe travel from island to island even across great distances. However, that is not true for all parts of the world. Swirling about the southern pole is a roiling storm held in check by the Thunder Lords (see Power Groups). The storm is called the Eye of Io, and it measures nearly one thousand miles in diameter. Some say the Eye of Io is a vestige of the ancient storm that sank the continents of Iomandra tens of thousands of years ago. 

Whatever the truth, only magically warded ships can enter the Eye safely, and even then, the Thunder Lords are just as likely to smash a ship to smithereens as brook intrusion into their tempestuous domain. It is also believed that the Eye of Io is a gateway to a distant plane called the Elemental Chaos, but any captain wishing to cross over must pay a king’s ransom in tribute to the Thunder Lords.

### THE FROSTFELL
The north pole of Iomandra is covered by a glacial mass that one might mistake for a true continent. This great icy wasteland is called the Frostfell. Rocky islands protrude from the thick sheets of ice here and there, but the land is frigid and inhospitable. White dragons and other cold-dwelling creatures lair in caves carved out of the rock and ice, and many ships have been lost exploring the Frostfell for secrets of the ancient dragon dynasties. Seafaring explorers are also drawn to the Frostfell by ageless rumors of a great caldera hiding an obsidian palace-fortress with the spoils of a thousand dragons locked in its vaults.

### IO'CALIOTH
**CITY OF JEWELS**

<div style='margin-top:10px'></div>



Io'calioth is the capital of the Dragovar empire and a hotbed of political intrigue. An island unto itself, Io'calioth stands atop the ridge of a sunken volcanic caldera, its mighty walls and gleaming towers visible for miles in every direction. Unlike most islands, Io'calioth has no dragon overlord. Here, the Emperor rules supreme.

While Emperor Azunkhan IX is away, rulership falls to his sister Kalavai, the Holy Regent. The ruler of the Dragovar Empire has ultimate authority but consults with a Council of Viziers, composed of nineteen high-ranking Grand Viziers supported by one hundred Viziers — all members of the divine caste. The Grand Viziers are appointed by the Emperor to serve as advisors and architects in matters of imperial law and religious doctrine. The Grand Viziers, in turn, appoint the Viziers, who ensure that laws and doctrine are upheld across the empire.

The city's defense falls to the arcane and martial castes jointly, although there's considerable friction between the two. The Tmir Okata sect of the arcane caste serves as the city's air force and consists of dragonborn mages who ride spectral drakes into battle. Another arcane sect, the Vost Miraj, focuses on espionage both at home and abroad. Meanwhile, the martial caste controls the city's naval and ground forces, including its wall defenses. In addition, the Drax Imperia — dragonborn death knights of the Imperial Honor Guard — belong to the martial caste as well.

The city itself is crescent-shaped. The horns of the crescent enclose an enormous harbor that's home to hundreds of vessels, many of them Dragovar warships. The tips of the "horns" are carved with gigantic likenesses of Bahamut and Tiamat, the inference being that the gods themselves protect the harbor and watch over all who come and go. The rest of the city is divided into districts, and non-dragonborn require special papers to travel to any district other than the Common Quarter.

<div style='margin-top:340px'></div>



The city's districts are described below in alphabetical order:

- **Artisan Quarter:** Home of the expert caste, this mixed residential and business district is home to the empire's finest craftspeople.

- **Common Quarter:** Dragovar commoners mingle with non-dragonborn in the busy streets and back-alleys of this residential district.

- **Eastwallow:** A labyrinthine slum inhabited by poor folk, thieves, and degenerates.

- **Khas Arcania:** Home of the arcane caste, this district contains the Incunabulum (the city library), the Arcane Bastion (where the leaders of the various arcane sects convene), and the Imperia Collegium (Io'calioth's university).

- **Khas Divinia:** Home of the divine caste, the Temples of Bahamut and Tiamat can be found here along with the Tower of Io (where the Council of Viziers convenes).

- **Khas Imperia:** The royal district and home of the imperial palace.

- **Khas Martia:** Home of the martial caste, this district contains the War College (where martial leaders are trained), the Armus (where military generals convene), and the Imperial Coliseum.

- **Khas Nobilia:** Home of the noble caste, this district contains rich estates situated on beautifully manicured lawns.

- **Naval Quarter:** The Dragovar shipyards are prominently situated here, along with supply houses and residences for the city's many shipwrights and shipbuilders.

- **Trade Quarter:** This district is filled with shops and warehouses, and all manner of trade is conducted here.

- **Westwallow:** A congested slum riddled with poverty and disease.

```
```



#### LOCAL KNOWLEDGE
All residents of Io'calioth know the following information:

##### Emperor Azunkhan IX
Cursed with the heart of an explorer, Azunkhan would rather sail the seas than be confined to the royal palace, heeding the advice of his viziers. Several months ago, he left Io'calioth aboard his flagship, the Dragon's Crown, and set out for adventure, leaving his sister Kalavai to rule the empire in his absence. The conflict brewing in the west between the Dragovar and the Myrthon has failed to bring the Emperor home, and many citizens believe that Azunkhan IX is gone for good. If the Emperor dies, his crown would fall to his oldest nephew — the son of his sister, Tzavenga.

##### Princess Kalavai, Holy Regent
Kalavai is a cruel and temperamental leader far too willing to heed the counsel of the Viziers, many of whom pursue dark agendas. A devotee of Tiamat, she has re-organized the Council of Viziers in recent years to include more Tiamat-worshiping Grand Viziers than Bahamut-worshiping ones. Many believe Kalavai has done this out of spite, for she despises High Priest Ajharath of the Temple of Bahamut, who reportedly talked down to her as a child. Kalavai is young — barely nineteen years old — and has never ventured far from the capital and therefore has little understanding of the empire over which she currently rules. That said, Kalavai is highly educated and gifted with keen instincts.

##### The Council of Viziers
After the imperial throne, the Council of Viziers is the most powerful political entity in the Dragovar empire. It advises the Emperor and answers to the Emperor. It consists of nineteen hand-picked Grand Viziers who serve for life (or until the Emperor deigns to relieve them). The Grand Viziers are supported by one hundred Viziers, whom the Grand Viziers elect. All of the Viziers and Grand Viziers are members of the divine caste, and each one pledges a vow of allegiance to either Tiamat or Bahamut.

The Council convenes once per month in the Tower of Io to discuss laws and religious doctrine, hear problems afflicting the empire, and bring unsolved matters to the Emperor. During the Emperor's absence, the Council reports to the Holy Regent. The Council itself suffers from a blight, as many of its members eagerly conspire to gain more political power. Usually their ambitions are held in check by the Emperor as well as the arcane and martial castes. Usually.

##### The Vost Miraj
The Vost Miraj is a sect of the arcane caste devoted to magical espionage and counter-espionage. Its members are trained to use spells that enable them to infiltrate enemy strongholds, gather information without being detected, and get the drop on enemy spies. 

##### The Tmir Okata
Another sect of the arcane caste, the Tmir Okata are combat-trained battle-mages who collectively serve as Io'calioth's air force. They ride into battle on spectral drakes, wearing golden masks to hide their faces. All members of the Tmir Okata take a vow of silence, communicating with each other using subtle body and sign language.

### IO'GALAROTH
**CITY OF CAVES**
___
The City of Caves is a pivotal location where adventurers can strike it rich, buy their own ship, and rub shoulders with sea captains. However, it's also a den of villainy, rife with treachery, piracy, and double-dealers. Many of the people who live and conduct their business here aren't nice people, and visitors are expected to tolerate a certain amount of avarice.

Io'galaroth is big, with a population to rival the capital of Io'calioth. With its subterranean grottoes and labyrinth of tunnels, it's one the most defensible strongholds in the Dragovar empire. One typically enters the city by two great sea caves, which connect to a series of six flooded grottoes. The grottoes are partially open to the sky, allowing flying creatures to enter from above. Wide tunnels from the city break the surface as well, allowing caravans from the villages above to reach the city.

The six grottoes that form the core of the city have names. The **Seakissed Grotto** and the **Brokenwave Grotto** contain numerous docks for visiting ships, and most of the merchants who come by sea berth their ships here. These grottos contain ample inns, taverns, and warehouses to serve their needs, as well as shrines to "lesser" gods such as Erathis, Melora, and Selûne. The **Venomspine Grotto** is reserved for Dragovar warships and contains the city's shipbuilding facilities. The **Golden Shark Grotto** and the **Fishbelly Grotto** contain ships, residences, shops, and warehouses belonging to the city's indigenous population. The city's seamy underworld is also centered here. The deepest and best-defended grotto is the **Dragon's Grotto**, where the Dragovar nobility lives in relative luxury alongside the ostentatious Temples of Bahamut and Tiamat. 

Docks and piers line the walls of grottos, and buildings are stacked atop one another to dizzying heights. Wood and rope suspension bridges span the tunnels that connect the grottos, allowing pedestrians to cross the city without having to travel by ship. Connecting the grottoes are hundreds of miles of tunnels leading to squalid neighborhoods, fungi farms, cisterns, and deeper caverns full of monsters that are occasionally hunted, captured, and enslaved.

```
```

The City Watch consists primarily of Dragovar soldiers, many of them corrupt or susceptible to corruption. The rest are indoctrinated locals with very little military experience. The soldiers spend most of their time tracking down arsonists and murderers, with limited success. The many tunnels make it easy for one to "get lost" in Io'galaroth. The authorities mostly rely on the island's dragon overlord to keep the people in line. Although Castanamir has little interest in politics (like most dragons), he frequently walks the streets of Io'galaroth in polymorphed form, and people are trained to believe that he could be anyone, anywhere. Castanamir is quick to dispose of those who aggravate him. Fear of the dragon keeps most of the local population in line.

#### PERSONALITIES OF IO'GALAROTH

Io'galaroth has a population of roughly 90,000 people. A few noteworthy individuals are presented below:

- **Fayal Taviq** (dragonborn): Magistrate of Castanamir. 

- **Imazhia** (dragonborn): High Priest of the Temple of Bahamut.

- **Dharz Khevvir** (dragonborn): High Priest of the Temple of Tiamat.

- **Zaibon Krinvazh** (tiefling): Leader of the Horned Alliance, a thieves' guild comprised of tieflings.

- **Valzan Ambershard** (dwarf): Retired Sea King and leader of the Golden Shield, a rival thieves' guild.

- **Cale Blackstrand** (human): An agent of Zardkarath and member of the Adamant Fist.

- **Prismeus** (tiefling): Zaibon Krinvazh's acid-scarred lieutenant.

- **Arradas Arzantyr** (dragonborn, lich): Leader of the Jhal Shard in Io'galaroth.

- **Wolvar Markolak** (dwarf): Owner of a notorious gambling haven called the Leering Skull.

- **Clef Wimbly** (gnome): An information broker.

#### LOCAL KNOWLEDGE
All residents of Io'galaroth know the following information:

<div style='margin-top:4px'></div>

##### Castanamir, the Gold Dragon
The gold dragon is known to prowl the city streets in humanoid form, and people who displease the dragon tend to disappear without a trace. Fear of Castanamir keeps most of the local population in line, and visitors are advised to conceal their illicit affairs lest the dragon catch word and demand his "piece of the action." Rumors aside, Castanamir appears to have no interest in Dragovar politics and pretty much leaves the city in the care of the island's magistrate and the City Watch. Castanamir has erected a rather ostentatious palace near the western coast, tucked behind hills that cleverly block his view of his ugly neighbor island, Mheletros.

<div style='margin-top:4px'></div>

##### Mheletros
The dark, craggy island of Mheletros is inhospitable and nearly bereft of life—a striking counterpoint to its lush neighbor, Castanamir. However, the island's adamantine dragon overlord has no complaints. Mheletros commands the largest prison in the entire Dragovar empire (**Zardkarath**), and he takes pride in the fact that no one has ever escaped without his consent. Mheletros also has a ready supply of food and thousands of Dragovar soldiers to do his bidding. Every year, the dragon celebrates the Day of the Wicked (23 Garyx) by devouring 100 prisoners hand-picked by the prison warden.


Only the worst criminals of the empire end up in Zardkarath, and their best hope of escape is to find someone willing to pay Mheletros a bribe. However, Mheletros's demands tend to be exorbitant. Beyond that, only the official pardon of a Dragovar vizier or the Emperor himself can free one from the bleak hell of Zardkarath. Even then, the adamantine dragon doesn't part with his prisoners easily and often sends agents out to recapture those he's "let go" the instant they commit any infraction.

##### The Magistrate
Fayal Taviq is the latest in a long line of impotent city officials. He doesn't have the respect of the local population, and his edicts are rarely enforced by his underlings. The citizens are grateful only that he's not a tyrant. Very few of the "common folk" have ever seen or met him, for Taviq tends to limit himself to the company of well-armed guards and members of the noble caste. According to rumor, Taviq doesn't like to get his hands dirty, and he views his assignment to Io'galaroth as a punishment. He is constantly distracted by reports of the goings-on in the Dragovar capital of Io'calioth and often speaks of a desire to "return home" one day.

<div style='margin-top:4px'></div>

##### The Temples of the Dragon Gods
The Temples of Bahamut and Tiamat (and their respective leaders) rarely see eye to eye, but oddly enough, they are a calming influence in the city. Whatever rivalry that exists between them rarely spills into the streets, and locals believe that as long as the temples can get along with one another, there's hope for the future of Io'galaroth.

```
```



##### The Horned Alliance & the Golden Shield
There's a common saying in the City of Caves: "Honesty, stupidity—what's the difference?" Thievery is a common practice in Io'galaroth, where most children are taught that it's better to take what you want than earn it—provided you don't get caught. It's hardly surprising, therefore, that Io'galaroth has become a haven for some of the worst criminal elements in the Dragovar empire. Of particular note are the Horned Alliance, a thieves' guild comprised entirely of tieflings, and the Golden Shield, a thieves' guild run by a retired Sea King.

The Horned Alliance contains more than it's fair share of malcontents afflicted with an overdeveloped sense of entitlement. It harbors many tieflings who are angry at the injustices inflicted upon their people by the Dragovar regime. Conversely, the Golden Shield is more interested in earning profit than undermining the Dragovar empire and spitting in its face. However, both thieves' guild operate similarly, relying on extortion, blackmail, theft, and murder to fill its coffers and tighten its hold on the city. The two guilds despise one another and constantly try to subvert each other's endeavors.

##### The Adamant Fist
With so many criminals in the city, it pays to have agents of Zardkarath around to remove the worst offenders. Collectively known as the Adamant Fist, these agents of Zardkarath have the equivalent of diplomatic immunity, and more disturbing is the fact that they conceal themselves among the local population. The only thing that keeps them in line is a thinly enforced law that requires them to gain the magistrate's written approval before removing anyone from the island. The leader of the Adamant Fist in Io'galaroth is a slimy human named Cale Blackstrand, who reports directly to Warden Drax of Zardkarath. He has several associates whose identities are, for the most part, unknown.

##### The Jhal Shard
The arcane caste of the Dragovar empire has many sects, including the Shan Qabal (a group devoted to arcane research) and the Jhal Shard (a group dedicated to enslavement magic). The Jhal Shard is particularly active in Io'galaroth, operating legally out of numerous workshops. Its members specialize in turning monsters, criminals, and malcontents into thralls using several different rituals—the most popular and reliable being a process by which the subject has ensorcelled gemstones embedded in its flesh, controlling and limiting its thoughts and actions. People live in fear of the Jhal Shard, but many local merchants and nobles have come to rely on the slaves they provide.

### THE BARONIES OF BAEL NERATH
The human empire of Bael Nerath crumbled when the continents of Iomandra sank into the Dragon Sea. The survivors lingered on the few remaining bits of land until the dragonborn dynasties swept in, “rescued” them, and took em as slaves. The descendants of Bael Nerath, freed from slavery, made a half-hearted attempt to rebuild their empire. They raised colonies on nine islands, which necessitated a pooling of resources. To ensure a fair exchange of goods, the islands formed the Trade Council, with one representative from each island. Unfortunately, human greed reared its ugly head, and the Trade Council became mired in corruption as its members took to calling themselves barons and formed secret alliances. Accusations of foul play and favoritism shattered all attempts to unite Bael Nerath, and today the islands are ruled by nine selfish barons who simultaneously oppose and rely on one another.
___
Two of the baronies—Ravan and Vhessek—have dragon overlords and are thus named after them. Baron Mystrum welcomed the iron dragon Ravan with open arms, and the two have struck an accord. Vhessek the black dragon is a savage tyrant, and many of the human inhabitants of Vhessek’s island have been devoured or driven off, while Baron von Ezengart remains as a puppet leader to discourage others from leaving. Dragons periodically accost the other seven islands of Bael Nerath, but to date the baronies have managed to drive them off or slay them (often with the help of adventurers).

### THE BLACK CURTAIN
A ship that travels west or east eventually comes to the Black Curtain, a miles-high barrier of dark mist that stretches across the horizon and envelops the world like a death shroud. Ships can’t sail around the Black Curtain without coming into contact with the Frostfell to the north or the Eye of Io to the south.

Within the Black Curtain, vision (including darkvision) is limited to a few feet. This alone is enough to discourage timid seafarers, but some believe that the Black Curtain isn’t boundless—that it hides idyllic lands untouched by the wrath of Io. Many hopeful explorers have passed through the Black Curtain, hoping to come out the other side and see a vast, unclaimed paradise. None of them have ever returned.

The Black Curtain hasn’t always existed; it came into being some years after Io sank the continents, but its origin is unknown. It had already grown quite immense by the time the Arkhosian dynasties recovered from the worldwide devastation. Perhaps the most troubling thing about the Black Curtain is that it seems to be closing in. Islands on the edge of the black mist are gradually being swallowed up. It may take years, but the Black Curtain will eventually engulf the entire world. Consequently, many learned scholars have dedicated their lives to solving the mystery of this sinister phenomenon.

### BAEL TURATH
To save itself from the tyranny of the dragonborn dynasties, the human empire of Bael Turath forged dark pacts with infernal powers, giving rise to tieflings. Flush with newfound might, Bael Turath openly defied the dragonborn and their dragon overlords, calling down hellfire, curses, and eldritch power to scour their enemies. Although it wiped out entire dragonborn dynasties and slew countless dragons, Bael Turath eventually fell to the sheer might of Arkhosia. Bael Turath’s cities fell into ruin, its few surviving noble houses bound, weeping and cursing, into slavery.


<div class='pageNumber'>10</div>
<div class='footnote'>IOMANDRA</div>

\page

When the continents sank into the Dragon Sea, nearly all of Bael Turath was submerged. A few ruins remain above sea level, tempting explorers. Even though centuries have passed and most of Bael Turath has been lost, the Deeplantern Guild and many others are drawn to the sunken empire by rumors of precious relics lost in the depths. Some seek a greater—and far more dangerous—prize within the sunken capital: a temple wherein lie the original pacts that transformed the devil-conspiring humans into tieflings and gave rise to the dark empire of Bael Turath. Mad prophets claim that a new emperor will arise among the tieflings, claim this ancient magic, and build a new empire to rival Bael Turath’s glory and splendor.

### CENDRIANE
The ancient dragonborn dynasties apparently had no interest in exploring and conquering other planes of existence. Consequently, when the beautiful eladrin kingdom of Cendriane was threatened with annihilation by dragonborn armies, its leaders evoked powerful rituals in a desperate attempt to shift the entire kingdom into a twilight reflection of Iomandra called the Feywild. Although the eladrin mastery of arcane magic was unrivaled, their rituals failed. Cendriane’s transposition into the Feywild shook the kingdom to its foundations. All of the magic in the world couldn’t keep its towers and walls from crumbling into ruin, and few eladrin survived the calamity. The survivors remained in the Feywild and began the long process of rebuilding Cendriane’s capital of Amethystra. These eladrin cloaked the crystalline city using the magic of the Feywild, hoping that intruders from Iomandra would have a difficult time locating it.

Roughly two centuries ago, eladrin spies returned to Iomandra to observe the changes there. They were shocked to discover that most of its lands had sunk beneath the sea and that the dragonborn dynasties of old were no longer a threat. A few families of eladrin have since rejoined the people of Iomandra, but they guard well the secrets of their new homeland for fear that knowledge of the Feywild’s abundant land might spur others to invade it.

### GAR MORRA
When the continents of Iomandra sank into the Dragon Sea, more than three-quarters of the dwarven kingdom of Gar Morra suddenly found itself underwater. The great mountains of Gar Morra now form rocky islands riddled with caves.

Freed from the tyranny of the dragonborn dynasties, the dwarves of Gar Morra returned to their ancestral kingdom to rebuild their strongholds, only to discover their islands overrun with orcs. For centuries now, the dwarves have been warring with these orcs, pushing them deeper down into the mountains. In the process, they’ve discovered large air pockets — vast cavern labyrinths filled with monsters far worse than orcs. The dwarves refer to this sprawling network of caverns as the Hollowdark (see below), and they would like nothing more than to rebuild their great kingdom in its protective depths.

In addition to rebuilding Gar Morra, the dwarves want to recuperate their lost wealth. Beneath the Dragon Sea lie the ruins of dwarf kingdoms and warded vaults filled with gold and other treasure that the dwarves aren’t willing to abandon. Consequently, the dwarves of Gar Morra are anxiously launching expeditions to these ancient sites to recover what they can.

### SANGHOR
Known as the Kingdom of Blood, the goblin nation of Sanghor has been destroyed and reborn countless times. Today Sanghor is little more than a scattering of rocky islands hewn into hideous fortresses. The goblins that infest these evil bastions worship Tiamat, and each tribe is ruled by a wyrmlord (usually either a hobgoblin or bugbear warlord). From time to time, a particularly powerful wyrmlord rises to unite the goblin tribes under a single banner with one purpose in mind: to slay the Dark Queen’s enemies and harvest their blood.

The goblins of Sanghor frequently ride dragons into battle. Tribal warpriests tend to the dragon hatcheries and raise the newly hatched wyrmlings so that they’re willing and eager to serve as mounts. These goblin warpriests feed the dragons a steady diet of meat and blood so that they remain devoted to the tribe and their Dark Queen.

Sanghor is also home to evil dragonborn who follow the teachings of Tiamat. Most of these dragonborn are Dragovar agents who seek to rekindle the glory of the ancient dynasties by enslaving all non-dragonborn races and seizing their lands.

### THE DEMONMAW SARGASSO
Due west of ancient Bael Nerath and the islands of Arkhosia lies a vast stretch of the Dragon Sea called the Demonmaw Sargasso. The perimeter of the sargasso is so shallow that sailors can see the black coral that covers the sea floor. After a few miles, these shallows give way as the sea floor plunges into an abyss, where the waters are eerily calm. A lucky ship can use oars to cross the sargasso without incident. An unlucky ship finds itself inexorably drawn to a location where the watery horizon dips menacingly into a briny vortex. By the time one sees the vortex, it’s already too late.

<div style='margin-top:13px'></div>


### THE VAULT

Hundreds of years ago, Erathis (the god of civilization and
invention) inspired the servants of Moradin (the god of creation and the forge) to build an extradimensional vault,
within which was hidden the treasures of bygone empires.
The vault’s architect was an astral giant named Runor
Everlast. After his work was complete, Runor decided to
remain in the vault as its eternal guardian. Moradin and
Erathis each appointed an angel to protect Runor and keep
him company: Mercion the Icereaver, and Kharandar the
Firehearted. Unfortunately for the angels, the astral giant
has since lost his grip on reality.

Many years ago, a small band of githyanki infiltrated
the vault by some means Runor could not ascertain.
Fearing that the vault had a flaw in its design, Runor set
about making “repairs.” Despite his endless toiling, Runor
still believes the vault’s security has been compromised.
Although the githyanki invaders were dispatched, the astral
giant is prone to hallucinations and sees githyanki in his
mind from time to time.
Mercion and Kharandar are obliged to protect Runor at
all costs, even if the giant puts himself in harm’s way. However, if Runor is slain, the angels are released from service
and harbor no ill will toward Runor’s slayers, and might
even be persuaded to help them. Both are eager to return
to the Astral Sea, but first they must find a way to escape
from the vault. Runor occasionally speaks of a secret means
of escape but always stops short of revealing the details.

<div style='margin-top:10px'></div>

### THE HOLLOWDARK
The Hollowdark is the name given to the subterranean realms of Iomandra, many of which flooded or collapsed when the continents sank thousands of years ago. What’s left of the Hollowdark can be reached via remote caves scattered on islands all across the Dragon Sea. Few surface dwellers have any clue what Hollowdark denizens may have survived the ancient calamity, and most don’t wish to find out. Consequently, known entrances to the Hollowdark are generally avoided.


<div style='margin-top:140px'></div>

### IO’DROTHTOR
##### City of Ghosts

<div style='margin-top:7px'></div>

Located on the island of Krethmidion, the City of Ghosts is the Eastermost major city of Arkosia. Io'drothtor is one of the oldest cities on Iomandra and known throughout the Dragon Sea for its beautiful coastal landscapes, its well-preserved architecture and its rich, vibrant history. Io'drothtor's best know feature are the mobs of benign ghosts that wonder its streets at night.

Io'drothtor has not always been a vibrant, currious, city, it has a lingering dark history to consider. When the Drogovar Empire went to war with, and ultimatly destroyed the tiefling nation of Bael Turath, the city was located on the front lines of that war. Many atrocities were commited and forgotten here, as the few surviving "enemys" passed through in chains.

When the Dragovar Dynasty ended slavery this island's master was the final holdout. Icristus, a wretched blue dragon, demanded slavery continue on his island. It was not until he was slain by a steel dragon, named Krethmidion, that the loathsome practice was ended.

####  Kalak Shun
Believed to be operating in Io'drothtor, the Kalak Shun are an arcane
sect of outcast dragonborn
wizards who practice necromancy. They are rumored to guard the Throat of Tharzuul, a portal leading to a subterranean elemental node deep under the city.

# Factions
___
As the Dragovar Dynasty declines in power, the vacuum left allows organizations of all nature and creed to prosper. The beings of Iomandra are resourceful, they have lived for a long time within strict limitations. Now they stretch their strength, intelligence, brutality across the dragon sea.

### THE DRAGOVAR DYNASTY
Iomandra has seen many empires rise and fall. The only one surviving to the present day is the Dragovar dynasty, a relatively young dragonborn empire with a rich history punctuated by periods of brutal tyranny and treachery. The Dragovar dynasty arose out of the marriage of two ancient rivals—the Arkhosian and the Myrthon dynasties. Neither dynasty proposed this alliance through marriage. It was imposed upon them by dragon prophets who believed that the union of these two enemies would put an end to their history of warmongering, ushering in a new era of peace. Instead, it led to a seething age of political backstabbing.
___

The Dragovar are the sworn servitors of Io and dragonkind. They are primarily dragonborn who worship Io’s surviving children, the godlings Bahamut and Tiamat. This decadent, tarnished empire conquered and annexed its rivals long ago, but many citizens fear for its future. Corruption plagues the government, disputes are still resolved by gladiatorial combat, and ancient Arkhosian–Myrthon blood feuds persist to this day. The current emperor is Azunkhan IX (a.k.a. Azunkhan the Seeker). His Exalted Highness would rather explore the Dragon Sea than sit on his throne in Io’calioth, which leaves his unscrupulous sister, Kalavai, to rule in his absence. The royal siblings are served by a coterie of bickering Grand Viziers and Viziers and defended by an honor guard of Arkhosian and Myrthon death knights who have served the imperial family since the dynasty’s founding.
___

Dragovar citizens pay tribute to the dragon overlords that rule their islands. These dragons do not answer to the emperor, and they are not bound by imperial law. They do as they please, although many of them are quite old and content to sleep for months on end.
___

For the first 257 years of its existence, the Dragovar dynasty supported slavery. Imperial law made it legal for dragonborn citizens to capture, keep, and sell slaves of other races. In 345 DY, Azunkhan III (a.k.a. Azunkhan the Mad) declared an end to slavery. He also gave credence to his former slaves’ claims that there were more gods in the heavens than Bahamut and Tiamat, and he legitimized the churches of Corellon, Erathis, Melora, Moradin, Sehanine, Zehir, and numerous other deities. Following a deluge of revolutionary proclamations and civic upheaval, the emperor’s corrupt viziers brutally assassinated Azunkhan III in 348 DY and installed his estranged son, Azunkhan IV (a.k.a. Azunkhan the Usurper), as the new emperor. Since then, leadership of the Dragovar dynasty has passed from father to son in the traditional fashion. The current emperor has no legitimate heirs, fueling concerns that the last dragonborn dynasty is nearing its end.
<div style='margin-top:25px'></div>



##### Emperors of the Dragovar Dynasty
|             |          |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Azunkhan I (the Great)  | 1-155 DY |
| Azunkhan II (the Ravager)  | 155-257 DY |
| Azunkhan III (the Mad) | 257-348 DY |
| Azunkhan IV (the Usurper) | 348-499 DY |
| Azunkhan V (the Conqueror) | 499-753 DY |
| Azunkhan VI (the Dragonking) | 753-901 DY |
| Azunkhan VII (the Prophet) | 901-1138 DY |
| Azunkhan VIII (the Wise) | 1138-1345 DY  |
| Azunkhan IX (the Seeker) | 1345-1474 DY |

The Emperor leaves matters of doctrine and law in the hands of the Council of Viziers, comprised of 19 grand viziers and 100 viziers—all members of the divine caste, and each one a representative of the Temple of Bahamut or Tiamat. Viziers are appointed by the grand viziers, and grand viziers are appointed by the Emperor. Emperors usually try to maintain an equilibrium in the council between Bahamut representatives and Tiamat representatives, but since Kalavai took control as regent, council representation has slanted in Tiamat's favor.

#### Cities of the Dragovar Empire
The Dragovar dynasty is spread over hundreds of islands, but there are relatively few cities of significant size.
<div style='margin-top:10px'></div>



##### Io’calioth (City of Jewels)
Referred to as the City of Jewels or the City of Corruption (depending on one’s point of view), Io’calioth is the last of the great draconic fortress-cities, as well as the home of Emperor Azunkhan IX. The crescent-shaped island upon which the city is built is actually a flooded caldera with buildings built into the inside walls. The city’s great harbor lies within the sunken caldera itself and is accessible through a narrow fissure in the caldera’s southern wall.

Ancient warships defend the city of Io’calioth from sea-dwelling threats. The imperial fleet also ensures that conflicts among the Sea Kings (see below) don’t hinder trade vessels entering and leaving the harbor.

#####  Io’drothtor (City of Ghosts)
Nestled in Turtle Bay along the southern coast of Krethmidion, the City of Ghosts gets its name from the forlorn spirits that haunt the city's streets and catacombs. These apparitions are harmless, and most of the city's living population pays little heed to them, but their presence can be unnerving to visitors. For reasons that escape even the most learned sages, anyone who perishes in Io'drothtor leaves behind a phantom "echo" of themselves before passing through the dark veil into the Raven Queen's clutches. These apparitions seem to manifest wills of their own, and they move freely about according to their own whims. However, some residents speculate that these phantoms secretly serve as the "eyes" and "ears" of a sinister agency operating within the city walls.

Io'drothtor is the Dragovar Empire's eastern stronghold, and numerous warships are moored in Turtle Bay to protect the harbor. Overlooking and enclosing the city are sheer black cliffs pockmarked with caves that serve as lookout points for Dragovar guards. The island's steel dragon overlord lurks in the heart of the island, behind a ring of jagged mountains called the Vaultcrags. Krethmidion comes to Io'drothtor twice per year (once in Lendys, and one in Erynian) to collect tribute.

<div style='margin-top:6px'></div>

##### Io'fazor (City of Stars)
The island of Kallahandros breaks the surface of the Dragon Sea and soars upward like a mountain, and surmounting its flat peak is the fortress city of Io'fazor. Soldiers of the martial caste come here to train, and tunnels lead from the city to the broken ring of docks that encircle the island's circumference. The city's central feature is a great observatory that contains arcane telescopes. The island's silver dragon overlord runs the observatory and spends endless hours studying the heavens.

<div style='margin-top:6px'></div>

##### Io’galaroth (City of Caves)
The island of Castanamir is home to a city built inside an underground labyrinth of basalt grottos. The city is almost entirely subterranean except for some gigantic fumaroles that break the island’s surface and allow light to filter into the city streets. Io’galaroth is a grim place, but nearly anything can be bought or sold here. The gold dragon Castanamir is known to wander the city disguised in humanoid form; visitors would be wise to speak well of him. The dragon has no interest in politics and rarely concerns himself with affairs in Io'galaroth. The city boasts more than its fair share of pirates and cutthroats, and two of the empire's most notorious thieves' guilds (the Horned Alliance and the Golden Shield) have well-defended strongholds here.

Io’galaroth boasts an impressive harbor, as well as shipbuilding facilities. Dragovar warships protect the harbor and keep a watchful eye on the neighboring island of Mheletros, carved into which is the haunting fortress-prison of Zardkarath. The adamantine dragon Mheletros lives somewhere deep inside the fortress and has been known to eat prisoners who misbehave.
<div style='margin-top:145px'></div>
##### Io'halador (The Sunken City)
This ancient Arkhosian city sank beneath the waves hundreds of years ago, although rumors abound that parts of the city hold magical supplies of air and are still inhabited. It lies a day's journey west of Hezemendor, a particularly large island in eastern Arkhosia.

##### Io'rasvim (City of Scrolls)
Io'rasvim is where Tsar Dakor, the Regent of Myrthon, resides. By order of the Dragovar Council of Viziers, the regent is forbidden to leave the city except by order of the Emperor, and then only in the company of Dragovar advisors assigned to counsel him. The City of Scrolls takes its name from its vast libraries of Draconic lore contained within its walls.

##### Io'vanthor (City of Tiers)
This city rests in the heart of Sytheron, an island ruled by a steel dragon. Io'vanthor watches over the Myrthon Regency to the west and the Kingdom of Sanghor to the south, looking for signs of trouble. The divine caste has a strong presence here, where the alliance between the Arkhosian and Myrthon dynasties was forged with the marriage of Emperor Azunkhan I to Kalavysti of Myrthon. Io'vanthor is called the City of Tiers because it's a multi-level walled city carved into the side of a mountain.

##### Io’zargoth (City of Fear)
This shattered stronghold of the Dragovar is now a haunted ruin ruled by the dracolich overlord Tao Feng. The dracolich can sense the presence of living creatures within several leagues of the island and delights in slaying all living souls who traverse its domain.

### THE SHAN QABAL
The Shan Qabal is a sect of the arcane caste that specializes in the study of new forms of magic, as well as the rediscovery of ancient forms of magic lost to the world. Its members are dedicated to research, and the urge to discover and harness new forms of magic has resulted in several competitive feuds within the sect.

The Shan Qabal is based in Io'calioth, although its members are scattered throughout the Dragovar empire. Members are notoriously ruthless in their quest for magical knowledge, plundering sacred sites without a second thought and sacrificing whatever they must to unearth new arcana. The sect's current leader is a venerable dragonborn arch-wizard named Lenkhor Krige. He reports to Grand Vizier Turazad, one of the Emperor's key advisors in Io'calioth, and has powerful allies within the divine and arcane castes.

#### THE WYRMWORN EXPERIMENT
<div style='margin-top:2px'></div>


The covert Shan Qabal endeavor known to a select few as "the Wyrmworn Experiment" demonstrates the depths to which this organization will sink in its quest for magical power.

In 1445 DY, a Shan Qabal expedition unearthed the Temple of the Wyrm's Eye, a five-thousand-year-old site rumored to have been destroyed in the great cataclysm. There, long ago, a secret covenant of ancient, spell-wielding dragons met to share rituals and find the means to achieve godhood. It took a decade of research, but the Shan Qabal discovered a means to summon the spirits of these dragon sorcerers back to the world. Initially, the Shan Qabal were interested only in communing with the spirits and learning their ancient knowledge, until Lenkhor himself devised a ritual that would enable them to trap the spirits inside of living hosts. Although Lenkhor tried to suppress this knowledge, word reached Turazad of the discovery, and he ordered Lenkhor to begin experimenting on living hosts. In 1455 DY, the Shan Qabal spirited 40 host candidates—all orphaned children—out of Io'galaroth, took them to the Temple of the Wyrm's Eye, and bound within each of them a slumbering dragon spirit that could be awakened upon command.

After the rituals were completed, the children were taken to a secret Shan Qabal facility in Io'halador to be raised, trained, and indoctrinated as loyal agents and assassins of the Dragovar empire. Meanwhile, back in Io'calioth, the Council of Viziers was in upheaval, and the political landscape was changing so radically that Turazad feared the Wyrmworn Experiment might jeopardize his political career. He ordered Lenkhor to terminate the experiment and destroy all of the evidence and documentation, including its subjects.

The Wyrmworn (as the children were called) were not exterminated as ordered but rather smuggled onto two ships headed west. One ship, the Tempest, made it to its destination, and the children disappeared soon thereafter. The other ship, the Morrow's Folly, was lost in a storm and presumed destroyed. Lenkhor informed Turazad that all of the children had been killed.

Nineteen years later, an ambitious Shan Qabal wizard named Hahrzan found proof in Io'halador that the Wyrmworn Experiment had not been terminated, as ordered. He shared his findings with Grand Vizier Turazad directly, behind Lenkhor's back. Turazad instructed Hahrzan to track down the surviving Wyrmworn and eradicate them, and gave Hahrzan all of the resources he demanded. Turazad also searched for evidence to support Hahrzan's assertion that Lenkhor Krige was complicit in the orphans' escape, but nothing surfaced. Given Lenkhor's wizened state and political connections, Turazad is more inclined to just let the feeble, tiresome wizard die of old age—much to Hahrzan's chagrin.

##### KNOWN MEMBERS
The following members of the Shan Qabal can be encountered in the campaign to date (and are presented in alphabetical order):

___
**Faerdan** (male elf): Serusa's murderous henchman had his right arm amputated and replaced with a symbiotic insectoid arm that he can attach or detach at will. When the arm is detached, Faerdan usually carries it around in a wooden case. The arm enhances his strength, and its talons are razor-sharp. If Faerdan dies, the arm detaches and continues to attack on its own.
___
**Hahrzan** (male dragonborn): Hahrzan oversees numerous Shan Qabal endeavors, operating out of the sunken city of Io'halador and elsewhere. Serusa, Javahn, Iojad, and Kalaryste all report to him. A failed magical experiment years ago resulted in Hahrzan not being able to breathe air. He is required to wear an armored leather body suit equipped with a gas mask, attached to which is a backpack that produces the magical admixture of poisonous gases that sustains him.
___
**Iojad** (male dragonborn): Iojad runs a secret elemental weapons foundry on the island of Zonjar. The Shan Qabal has been conducting research into elemental magic for years, but the foundry represents its first attempt to mass-produce elemental-powered weapons and vehicles for the Dragovar empire. Iojad believes the assignment puts him on the path toward becoming a leading member of the Shan Qabal, even though many of his peers consider him an overdeveloped worker drone who takes credit for the achievements of his underlings.
___
**Javahn** (male dragonborn): A courteous and open-minded member of the Shan Qabal who reports to Hahrzan, Javahn is charged with conducting and overseeing a secret auction of elemental weaponry at a hidden Shan Qabal research facility on the island of Tetherus.
___
**Kalaryste** (female human): Kalaryste works closely with Hahrzan and is very protective of him and his projects. She had both of her hands removed and replaced with insectoid symbionts, similar to the arm worn by Faerdan. She also built a clockwork swordmage that serves as her personal bodyguard. Her true area of expertise, however, is demon-binding magic, and she has a gang of shadow demon cronies that follows her around.
___
**Nilus Costeran** (male human): Nilus was indoctrinated into the Shan Qabal a little less than two years ago, but he quickly caught Hahrzan's eye after displaying his ruthless pursuit of magical lore. Nilus, in fact, bought his way into the sect by handing over several spellbooks he "acquiried" while studying magic in Bael Nerath. His expertise lies in elemental magic, and he keeps a magmin familiar close by.
___
**Serusa** (female dragonborn): Superficially polite, Serusa speaks slowly and precisely, in a manner best described as supremely condescending. She comes to the island of Kheth searching for a wrecked ship that disappeared with all hands some nineteen years ago. She wears a pair of magical, articulated spectacles that allow her to perceive dragon spirits. (A Wyrmworn viewed through the magic lenses radiates a pale aura that's otherwise invisible.)

### THE JHAL SHARD
The Jhal Shard is one of the more evil sects of the Dragovar arcane caste that practices a particularly vile form of arcana known as enslavement magic. Through the use of enslavement rituals, members of the Jhal Shard transform sentient creatures and monsters into thralls and then sell them for profit. Despite the current regime's distaste for slavery, the Jhal Shard are permitted to carry on their magical experiments unimpeded, largely because the majority of Dragovar viziers believe that the sect does more good than harm. The only regulation enforced by the Council of Viziers is that no dragonborn citizen of the empire can be turned into a Jhal Shard thrall.

The bulk of the subjects chosen for enslavement are monsters (the definition of which can, admittedly, vary). By turning captured monsters into subservient thralls, the Jhal Shard creates useful but disposable guardians, beasts of burden, and mounts. Sentient beings who fall victim to Jhal Shard magic usually have a checkered past and aren't the sorts of people that the empire would miss having around.

Usually the only ones who can afford to buy Jhal Shard thralls are members of the Dragovar noble caste. There are many corners of the world where the handiwork of the Jhal Shard is not really appreciated, including the Baronies of Bael Nerath and the shattered dwarven kingdoms of Gar Morra.


#### ENSLAVEMENT RITUALS
<div style='margin-top:12px'></div>

The Jhal Shard have developed many different enslavement rituals over the years. One of the most reliable requires the enslaved creature to have tiny gems magically stitched into its skin, such that the gems cover most of its body. The gems, while not particularly valuable, contain minor spells that work in concert to suppress the subject's rebellious thoughts. The gems cannot be removed without damaging or killing the host, and any attempt by the creature to resist the enslavement can be fatal.

Oddly enough, recipients of a Jhal Shard enslavement ritual are more resistant to charm effects or immune to them altogether—a feat of arcana intended to prevent a Jhal Shard thrall from being turned against its rightful owner.
<div style='margin-top:20px'></div>


##### KNOWN MEMBERS
The following members of the Jhal Shard can be encountered in the campaign to date:

**Arradas Arzantyr** (male dragonborn lich): Arradas lives an a secluded stone tower with a resolving upper floor that stands in the middle of a fungi-filled cavern beneath Io'galaroth. He is the leader of the Jhal Shard sect in Io'galaroth. He keeps his lich's phylactery hidden somewhere in the city above.
___
**Gorloth** (male human): Arradas has trained many apprentices over the years, and his latest is a balding, tattooed mage with a keen eye for worthy subjects. Gorloth handles most of Arradas's negotiations and transactions, and he never travels far without his favorite thralls: a pair of oni mages polymorphed into cloaked dragonborn.
<div style='margin-top:45px'></div>



### THE SEA KINGS
The Sea Kings are a group of independent warlords who govern trade on the Dragon Sea. Each Sea King commands their private armada of ships. Some Sea Kings are legitimate traders and merchants; others are privateers, freebooters, and bounty hunters in the service of the Dragovar. The rest are self-employed explorers, slavers, or pirates.

Thirty-three Sea Kings currently ply the waves, and their goals seldom align. Bitter rivalries among the Sea Kings have been known to escalate into major conflicts on the high seas, impacting trade across the entire world. That said, the Sea Kings of the modern day are somewhat more civilized than their barbaric predecessors. When faced with a common threat, they can present a unified front—at least for a short time. The Sea Kings convene regularly at the city-fortress of Krakenholt to discuss business and various sundry “opportunities.” Even then, such gatherings are usually attended by no more than a dozen Sea Kings. The rest simply can’t be bothered, either because they are at odds or have more pressing business half way around the world.

Very few Sea Kings are willing to swear fealty to the Dragovar of Arkhosia, either because the empire is too corrupt to be trusted or because they believe the empire’s demise is inevitable. Like vultures, they wait to feast on the Dragovar’s succulent, proverbial carcass.

Any sea captain who pledges allegiance to a Sea King gains the instant benefit of a powerful ally as well as some measure of protection against pirates and other threats (provided her ship flies the Sea King’s flag). Unaligned sea captains must often bribe the Sea Kings to safely traverse the seas, lest they be attacked, boarded, pillaged, and sunk.

Most commoners can name upwards of nine Sea Kings based solely on tales recounted in local taverns. Very few people know the names of all thirty-three Sea Kings. The following Sea Kings are among the most prolific:

#### Sea King Valkroi (Mykel Valkroi) 
A fair but brutal Sea King endorsed by the Thunder Lords, Valkroi claims to have sailed his flagship to the Elemental Chaos and back.

#### Sea King Senestrago (Evan Senestrago)
Valkroi’s ambitious rival and former shipmate, now a Sea King with one of the largest fleets on the Dragon Sea.

\page

#### Sea King Kalas (Lorelei Kalas)
Also known as the Black Wren of the Kalas, “Lady Lorelei” is good to the captains that serve her loyally and positively vicious to those who cross her.

#### Sea King Trystoval (Xelior Trystoval)
Rivals claim to have killed this half-elf Sea King in battle, yet he lives. With every “death,” he seems to gain more power and influence.

#### Sea King Deepstaff (Rhone Orlak)
The self-proclaimed “wizard of the waves,” Sea King Deepstaff has arguably the fastest fleet on the high seas. His “flagship” isn’t a ship at all, but a floating tower that skims across the surface of the Dragon Sea.

#### Sea King Firerazor (true name unknown)
A charismatic dragonborn exile who fights honorably and proudly, Firerazor has no love for the Dragovar dynasty. His flagship, the Inferno, is considered the most heavily armed and armored ship on the Dragon Sea, capable of sinking entire armadas by itself.
```
```

#### Sea King Mithralstar (Verdigris Mithralstar)
An intrepid, swashbuckling dwarf with expensive tastes and vast troves of hidden wealth, Sea King Mithralstar carries a magic horn that summons a terrible sea dragon when blown.

#### Sea King Eelbeard (Dargus Gragnar)
“Eelbeard” is a disgustingly fat, foul-mouthed dwarf with few redeeming qualities other than his appreciation for expensive ale. He’s one of the few Sea Kings who seems at all eager to do business with the Dragovar.

#### Sea King Zekh’r (Ediv Zekh’r)
Zekh’r is a vicious pirate with the uncanny gift of second sight. Many other Sea Kings consider him the bane of their existence, but he always seems to get the better of them. Sea King Mithralstar has an standing bounty on Zekh’r’s head that increases with each passing month.

#### Krakenholt
The island fortress-town of Krakenholt is where the Sea Kings conduct business and unite against common threats. Some of the more unscrupulous Sea Kings also hide slaves in Krakenholt’s dungeon, counting on the town’s defenses to safeguard their “property.”

#### Anchordown
Anchordown is one of the largest “raft towns” on the Dragon Sea, with a population of over 800 people. In lieu of islands to colonize, the people of Iomandra hit upon the idea of building mobile settlements atop large, interwoven rafts. These floating towns can be taken apart and relocated as needs arise.
Anchordown hasn’t moved in over fifty years, and its rafts are so decrepit and its buildings so ramshackle that the town would likely fall apart if any attempt were made to dismantle it. Like many raft towns, it is overrun with exiles, pirates, and other shady characters wanted by Arkhosian authorities.

#### The Fathomreaver
This legendary cutlass, lost in the Battle of the Roiling Cauldron (1455 DY), is thought to be a gift to the Sea Kings from the goddess Melora herself, granting its wielder command of the ocean. The blade was last held by Sea King Draeken Malios and is sought by every reigning Sea King worth his salt. As a symbol, the Fathomreaver could unite the Sea Kings under one flag if its wielder were powerful enough.
<div style='margin-top:5px'></div>



### THE KNIGHTS OF ARDYN
Ardyn is a silver dragon that seeks to destroy the Dragovar dynasty. She has nothing against dragonborn, but she believes wholeheartedly that the Dragovar bloodline and the Grand Viziers have forsaken Bahamut and become corrupt beyond salvation. Ardyn seeks to depose the tyrannical monarchy, and this desire makes her very popular with enemies of the royal bloodline. 

She is served by scores of loyal knights from all walks of life. These Knights of Ardyn are always on the lookout for others who share their aims, but for the moment there are too few of them to challenge the Dragovar openly.
The Dragovar want to crush Ardyn’s knighthood but cannot act against Ardyn directly because she’s a true dragon. Her knights, however, are fair game.

#### Ardynrise
Ardynrise is the name of Ardyn’s secret refuge. Here she meets with her knights to plot the downfall of the Dragovar dynasty. The location of Ardynrise is the most closely guarded secret of the knighthood, and getting there is difficult to say the least. High-ranking knights carry a magical talisman that enables Ardyn to summon them when she seeks their counsel; this is the only way by which a knight may enter her secret refuge.

### THE DEEPLANTERN GUILD
The Deeplantern Guild was founded ten years ago by a band of human and halfling entrepreneurs who realized the vast spoils that wait to be discovered at the bottom of the Dragon Sea. The Deeplanterns plan extensive forays into the lost ruins of sunken empires. They also keep a sizable percentage of what they find, which enables them to fund future expeditions without the need to rely on benefactors. The Deeplantern Guild can also be hired to find anything that’s been lost at sea, including sunken ships and precious cargo.

The guild has representatives in every city and raft-town, and they’re always looking for new members. Members are required to deal honestly and maintain an adventurous spirit. Members of the guild also enjoy several perks, including sea-travel discounts and free access to water breathing magic.


### THE THUNDER LORDS
The Thunder Lords are a group of storm titans that inhabit the titanic maelstrom known as the Eye of Io (see above). These tempestuous giants have the power to unleash the Eye of Io upon the world, and so the Sea Kings pay them tribute to keep the great storm “trapped” above the southern pole.

It is rumored that the Thunder Lords serve a powerful being or force of nature called the Harridan. Whether they serve the Harridan out of fear or respect is unknown. Scholars speculate that the Harridan might be an exarch of the goddess Melora, a monstrous kraken or leviathan that stirs the sea beneath the storm, or a forsaken sibling of Bahamut and Tiamat.

### WITCHES OF THE WEIRD
The Witches of the Weird, sometimes called mind mages, are githyanki spellcasters who wield psionic power. They are gaunt, human-like beings with sunken black eyes, ornate apparel, and dour dispositions. Their mastery of the weird allows them to influence the minds of others, from the lowliest servant to the mightiest emperor. The Witches of the Weird form a tightly knit covenant whose true agenda remains a mystery. However, it is believed that the Witches came to Iomandra many years ago aboard ships that crossed over from the Astral Sea. Their ships are swift, peculiar in design, and defended by similarly gaunt knights clad in baroque armor and wielding weird blades (mercurial swords formed out of psionic energy).

The Grand Viziers of the Dragovar dynasty employ Witches of the Weird as advisors and also use them to scour Dragovar communities for spies, traitors, and would-be royal assassins. However, many citizens fear that the witches have a hold over the Grand Viziers and are manipulating them for some ill purpose.

#### Mragvar
The Witches of the Weird claim the island of Mragvar as their refuge—a place where they can gather in secret and share information. Jagged rocks and sheer black cliffs discourage seafaring vessels from landing on its shores, but the northeastern face of Mragvar is split by a tall, narrow canyon that leads to a cove deep within the island’s interior. Within this cove the Witches of the Weird hide their fleet of Astral ships.

### HORNED ALLIANCE

<div style='margin-top:8px'></div>

The Horned Alliance is a powerful tiefling thieves’ guild opperating in most major cities on Iomandra.  This tieflings-only club of miscreants and malefactors operates something like the Mafia, it wants to mind its own business (however criminal) and be left alone.

Most members of this guild hate the Dragovar Empire, for it has not only destroyed the tiefling kingdom of Bael Turath but enslaved its people for generations. Even today, in Dragovar society, most tieflings are regarded as third-class citizens.
The Dead Crow, a tavern in Io’calioth, serves as a front for the Horned Alliance.

<div style='margin-top:8px'></div>


##### Known Members
The following members of the Horned Alliance might be encountered in the campaign:

<div style='margin-top:5px'></div>

____
**Suffer** (male tiefling): A brutal thug with a whale-sized attitude problem.
___
**Zaibon Krinvazh** (male tiefling): Lives on a ship called the Hellstrike and collectes the flayed bones of his adversaries. He is the leader of the Io'Galaroth brach of the oraganization.
___
**Prismeus** (male tiefling):  This tiefling henchman works for
Zaibon Krinvazh and has
been loyal to the crime lord ever since Zaibon
bailed him out of prison. While imprisoned,
Prismeus was tortured by his dragonborn captors, his face scarred by acid. His ill treatment
and disfigurement has made him resentful of all
dragonborn, and his loyalty to Zaibon is beyond
reproach
____
**Dorethau Vadu** (female tiefling): Old, wise, and not about
to pick a fight with a bunch of people who slay monsters for a living. The Horned Alliance is her house, its members are her children and grandchildren
(metaphorically speaking). She would be likeable and admirable and eats dragonborn babies.
___
**Ernest Shallowpool** (male halfling): Confidante and butler of Dorethau Vadu
___
**Zaidi Arychosa** (female tiefling): Legendary aria singer and wealthy dilettante. She plies the Dragon Sea aboard her luxury octopus ship, the Turathi Flame.
___
**Valkon Garmûl** (male dwarf): Disenfranchised member of the Golden Shield turned defector and informant for the Horned Alliance in Io'galaroth.
___
**Enif Mizviir** (male tiefling): Cowardly blacksash dealer in Io'galaroth, with connections to the Horned Alliance.
_____
**Nensis** (male tiefling): Low-ranking member of the Horned Alliance in Io’galaroth.
____
**Stray** (male tiefling): Up-and-coming member of the Horned Alliance in Io’galaroth. He wields a flaming boomerang.

<div style='margin-top:150px'></div>



### TRADE ORGANIZATIONS
Along with the Sea Kings, a number of organizations keep the economy on Iomandra afloat.

<div style='margin-top:5px'></div>

#### Winterleaf Coster
In the world of Iomandra, wood is rare and highly prized for shipbuilding. The Winterleaf Coster is a large elven seafaring wood-trading consortium holding lucrative shipbuilding contracts from the  Dragovar Empire. *Torel Winterleaf* (male elf) is the First lord of the Winterleaf Coster based in Io'calioth, and the ex-husband of Thariel von Zarkyn.

#### Ironstar Cartel 
The Ironstar Cartel is a rival consortium from the dwarven islands of Gar Morra. They hope to win a lucrative shipbuilding contract with their prototype iron ships. 

#### Nerathi Consortium
A trade organization based from the human islands of Bael Nerath. The consortuim is suspected of having Myrthon sympathies. *Vincent van Hyden* (male human) is the Chief representative of the Nerathi Consortium in Io'calioth, City of Jewles.

### THE TEMPLES
All of the core deities described in the Player’s Handbook are worshiped on Iomandra. Within the Dragovar Empire, the temples of Bahamut and Tiamat hold sway and maintain a tenuous equilibrium. 

It is forbidden to erect temples to other gods, although shrines to "lesser gods" are permitted. In major cities, it's not uncommon to find shrines dedicated to the many gods of the core D&D pantheon, particularly Melora (goddess of the sea), Erathis (goddess of civilization), and Selûne (goddess of the moon).

<div style='margin-top:100px'></div>



### THE CALENDAR
The old Arkhosian and Myrthok calendars were abandoned when the Dragovar dynasty formed. It is now the fourteen hundred and seventy-fourth Year of the Dragovar (1474 DY). Across Iomandra, it is widely held that there are 7 days in a week, 4 weeks in a month, and 12 months in a year.

# Races of Iomandra
___
For your character, you may choose any race from the Player’s Handbook. This section gives you some character hooks based on the race you select. (Other race options are permitted with the DM's permission.)
<div style='margin-top:10px'></div>

### DRAGONBORN
To a great extent, events on Iomandra seem to revolve around the affairs of dragonborn. They rule the greatest empire—albeit a fading one—and have a difficult road ahead. If you play a dragonborn, here are some things to remember:
- You are probably a citizen of the Dragovar. If you are not a citizen of the Dragovar, you are an exile.
- Dragonborn citizens who belong to the arcane, divine, or martial castes (i.e., belong to a class tied to any one of these power sources) have no last names and no family ties.
- From what you know of Emperor Azunkhan IX, he’s not an evil tyrant. That said, he’s never won the hearts of the dragonborn people—no great victories in battle, no groundbreaking legislation, nothing.
- As a dragonborn adventurer, you can try to save the Dragovar dynasty from a slow death, supplant the corrupt monarchy, lead the dragonborn nation of Arkhosia to some heretofore unknown destiny, join the Knights of Ardyn, spread faith in Bahamut, or crush the evil forces of Tiamat.
<div style='margin-top:16px'></div>

### DWARVES
Thousands of years ago, the dwarves were slaves of the dragonborn. When Io submerged the continents of the world, the dwarves led a massive uprising against their dragonborn oppressors and won their freedom. Their joy was short-lived, however, as they returned to their ancestral homelands to find all but one of their kingdoms wiped out. Some dwarves have committed themselves to rebuilding Gar Morra, but most dwarves are scattered across the Dragon Sea, living among the humans, halflings, elves, and others. If you play a dwarf, here are some things to remember:
- Dwarves have long memories and haven’t quite forgiven the dragonborn, but they’re trying.
- Status within dwarven society is based on wealth; the rich lead, and the poor follow.
- Dwarves are elemental souls with as much fondness for the open sea as the land.
- As a dwarf adventurer, you can search for the glory that comes only from wealth, help your people rebuild the kingdom of Gar Morra, build your own ship in the name of Moradin, forge new relations with the dragonborn, explore the mysteries of the Hollowdark, or slay the orcs who murdered your kin.
<div style='margin-top:1000px'></div>

### ELADRIN
The eladrin fled to the Feywild to escape slavery. However, many eladrin died when their rituals failed to transport the kingdom of Cendriane safely to the fey realm. Over the millennia, the eladrin have rebuilt their kingdom and mastered arcane magic. Two hundred years ago, eladrin began returning to Iomandra in small numbers, hoping to re-establish links to their past. If you play an eladrin, here are some things to remember:
- You were born and raised on Iomandra. You’ve never been to the Feywild.
- You know that most eladrin and a few elves reside in the Feywild.
- The Feywild is a reflection of Iomandra before its continents sank into the sea. Consequently, land there is bountiful. Sharing this knowledge with the more expansionist nations of Iomandra would almost certainly lead to an invasion of the Feywild.
- As an eladrin adventurer, you can choose to explore Iomandra for lost eladrin who know nothing about the Feywild, quell threats of a Feywild invasion, search for allies among the elves, or unearth arcane lore lost since the sinking of the continents.
<div style='margin-top:14px'></div>

### ELVES
Thousands of years ago, when Io sank the continents of Iomandra to punish his children, the elves were forced to leave their primeval forests and flee to high ground. They sought sanctuary in dwarf mountain strongholds and elevated human settlements. Present-day elves are scattered across the Dragon Sea, sharing the remaining land with their human and halfling neighbors, inhabiting forests wherever they are found, and seeding new ones. If you play an elf, here are some things to bear in mind:
- Present-day elves have no kingdoms or nations. They are geographically tied to humans and frequently breed with them, creating half-elves.
- You were probably born and raised on islands inhabited by humans, dwarves, and other races.
- You know that elves and eladrin are closely related. You have heard of a distant place called the Feywild, where the eladrin fled (along with a few elves) to escape the ancient dragonborn empires.
- As an elf adventurer, you can seek to learn more about the Feywild, search for clues about the elven kingdoms of the past, protect the remaining forests of Iomandra, or slaughter every last goblin in the Kingdom of Blood (see Sanghor).

### HALF-ELVES
The half-elves of Iomandra are not a true-breeding race. They are, in fact, the offspring of elf and human parents. Consequently, they do not have a nation of their own but co-exist with elves and humans on many different islands across the Dragon Sea. If you play a half-elf, here are some things to bear in mind:

<div class='pageNumber'>22</div>
<div class='footnote'>RACES OF IOMANDRA</div>

\page

- You were born out of the union of an elf and a human.
- You may have been born in one of the baronies of Bael Nerath.
- As a half-elf adventurer, you can seek to become an island magistrate, unite the feuding baronies of Bael Nerath, save the Dragovar dynasty from the corruption consuming it, amass sufficient treasure to buy a ship, become a Sea King, avenge a slain parent, find a missing parent, or search the ruins of ancient human and elven kingdoms for lost relics tied your diverse heritage.
<div style='margin-top:12px'></div>

### HALFLINGS
In ancient times, the halflings of Iomandra were nomadic river-folk. They plied the rivers between the elf, dwarf, and human nations, trading goods and information. Like many races, they were conquered and enslaved by the dragonborn until they finally won their freedom. Then the continents sank, and the halflings traded their riverboats for larger seafaring vessels. Although some halflings have settled on island shores, a great many ply the Dragon Sea, trading goods and information as their ancestors did millennia ago. If you play a halfling, here are some things to remember:
- You bear dragonborn no ill will for the crimes of the distant past. All of that is best forgotten.
- You are probably the most likeable and adaptable person you know.
- Humans would be dangerous if they didn’t bicker and complain so much.
- As a halfling adventurer, you can join the Deeplantern Guild, amass sufficient treasure to buy a ship, chart the rivers of the Hollowdark, explore new islands, draw the most complete map of Iomandra the world has ever seen, or lift the spirits of your adventurous colleagues.
<div style='margin-top:12px'></div>

### HUMANS
Arguably the most territorial and pernicious race, humans are masters of their own destinies. Still, many of them feel they deserve better. Once slaves of the ancient dragonborn dynasties, humans won their freedom after considerable bloodshed, only to have their nations and kingdoms wiped away by the cataclysm that sank the continents. Since then, they’ve been colonizing as much of the remaining land as they can, hoping to one day become as powerful as the empires of old. Many humans hail from the shattered baronies of Bael Nerath, but they are found the world over in surprising numbers. If you play a human, here are some things to remember:
- Humans get along well with all the other races, including tieflings and dragonborn.
- Humans do not hold the greatest power in Iomandra right now.
- There’s a good chance that you’re the descendant of a great explorer or champion.
- As a human adventurer, you can seek to become an island magistrate or baron, the ruler of the unified kingdom of Bael Nerath, a legendary dragon-slayer, a ship captain, a Sea King with command of an armada, a high-ranking member of the Deeplantern Guild, a noble Knight of Ardyn, a wizard with the power to raise continents, or the leader of an influential guild or religious order.

### TIEFLINGS
Like the eladrin, the humans of Bael Turath took desperate measures to escape the tyranny of the ancient dragonborn dynasties. Unlike the eladrin, however, they chose confrontation over escape. They forged infernal pacts, transformed themselves into tieflings, and gained vast eldritch power. Still, their newfound “gifts” weren’t enough to save the empire from the furious onslaught of the Arkhosian armies. The tieflings who survived were made into slaves. In time, they gained their freedom, but the empire of Bael Turath has fallen into legend. If you play a tiefling, here are some things to bear in mind:
- You accept who and what you are: the heir of an ancient, noble dynasty that did what was necessary to survive.
- Your people are scattered across Iomandra and don’t really have a home to call their own.
- You like having friends, even if some of them doubt your intentions from time to time.
- As a tiefling adventurer, you can seek to learn more about your noble family by exploring the sunken ruins of Bael Turath, restore the empire of Bael Turath to its former glory, bring stability or ruin to the Dragovar dynasty, usurp command of a Sea King’s armada, rule your own island as magistrate, help other tieflings who have lost their way, or repay a debt to a loyal friend.

# Tides that Bind
___

The campaign begins on the isle of Kheth, which was declared part of the Dragovar dynasty in 1375 DY.

Dragonborn explorers first discovered the island in 808 DY and named it Azun’zadi. A cursory examination revealed that it was infested with terrible monsters, so the explorers left it alone. By the mid-nine hundreds, Azun’zadi had become a favorite hunting ground for Dragovar warriors and nobility. Eventually they expunged the worst of the island’s inhabitants, leaving it ripe for colonization.

The island today is mostly civilized, with a few dark areas and caves where monsters continue to thrive. The island’s best-known landmark, apart from the small coastal town on its eastern shore, is an ancient ruin on a hill marked with serpentine statuary, and beneath the ruin, a partially collapsed dungeon complex adorned with serpentine motifs.

Various dragon overlords have claimed the island over the years, renaming it accordingly. In 1100 DY, a green dragon named Kheth wrested the island from a copper dragon named Irindol and renamed it after himself. Future visitors would thereafter refer to the island by its new name or suffer the consequences.

### TYRAK'N

Tyrak’n is the largest settlement on the island, built upon its eastern shore. “Tyrak’n” is short for Tyrak’s Town, named after the human explorer Tyrak von Zarkyn. In 1369 DY, Tyrak came to the island in search of treasure and encountered hill giants and orcs wandering the hills. After much bloodshed, Tyrak’s crew defeated the giants and orcs and took their gold. Tyrak used most of his spoils to build a trading post that has since grown into a small town. Tyrak established trade routes to other civilized islands, and the Dragovar rewarded his intrepidity by making Tyrak the island’s magistrate.

Tyrak’s grandson Cyrik is the current magistrate and oversees all business in Tyrak’n. Nothing ever seems to slip past his guard, thanks to his wife Thariel, who has an uncanny gift for knowing everything about everyone in town.

The wooden palisade that once protected Tyrak’n has partially been replaced by a new stone wall. Construction of the fortified wall is progressing slowly due to a lack of funds and skilled stonemasons, but Magistrate von Zarkyn is determined to complete the work in the next year or two.

The buildings of Tyrak’n are mostly single-story wooden affairs, with a few notable exceptions. Von Zarkyn Manor is a two-story stone house with a turret in one corner. Across the street is the stone Temple of Avandra. Tyrak’n also has an old stone garrison tower atop a hillock, although it needs work and is currently encased in wooden scaffolding.

The caravel that brought Tyrak to the island over a hundred years ago is now a permanent feature of the town docks. The Talisman has been gutted and transformed into a tavern and brewery. The Talisman’s proprietor, a jovial tiefling named Lucius, is also the proud brewer of Tyrak’n’s notorious Impstinger Ale. One of Lucius’s longtime acquaintances, Captain Ghordan Raiko of the Lantheon, is a merchant who brings trade goods to Tyrak’n every month. Raiko’s arrival is always a cause for celebration at the Talisman.

Nineteen years ago, a ship called the Morrow’s Folly ran aground during a rare torrential storm. The skeletal wreck lies just outside of the town proper and has been thoroughly plundered. The survivors of the wrecked ship (notably the captain and several very young children) were taken in by the local citizenry and still inhabit Tyrak’n to the present day. Captain Morrow has tried his best to help raise the children, but he refuses to speak about where he was taking them before the storm hit.

#### LOCAL KNOWLEDGE
All residents of Tyrak’n know the following information about the island and its neighbors:

##### Island Geography
The island of Kheth is triangular in shape and roughly 50 miles across (north to south). Beaches line the north, east, and south coasts, with sheer black cliffs to the west. A rain forest dominates the island interior, which rises and falls, creating a series of hills and gorges. The forest provides Tyrak’n with a ready supply of wood, rich topsoil, fruit, herbs, and meat, not to mention goods that can be traded to other islands for grain, wool, and various other commodities that Kheth can’t provide.

##### Island Weather
Kheth is a subtropical island. The summers are warm and humid, with frequent showers of misty rain. The heavy rain usually comes in the winter, when the temperature is mild during the day and cool enough for long sleeves at night. Thunderstorms are common, but the sea remains calm throughout the year. Once or twice each winter, the island is peppered with hail, but these hailstorms turn to rain quickly.

##### Island Life
Tyrak’n is the only settlement on Kheth. The remainder of the island is home to harmless subtropical wildlife as well as stirges, fire beetles, snakes, spiders, scorpions, boars, and the odd spitting drake. Before the island was colonized, Dragovar nobles used to hunt rage drakes on the island, but there don’t seem to be any more of them around (which is a good thing).

##### Kheth, the Green Dragon
The island of Kheth is named after its current overlord, a sly and paranoid green dragon the size of a killer whale. Kheth demands tribute from the island’s other residents, but the tribute isn’t exorbitant (monthly cattle and gold), and once appeased the dragon keeps to himself.

Kheth’s claim of the island has not gone unchallenged. Seven years ago, another green dragon came to the island, presumably to usurp Kheth’s rule, but Kheth drove it off after a fierce battle. Visiting sailors sometimes speak of a copper dragon making wide circles around the island; some speculate that the dragon is Irindol, the island’s previous overlord, whom Kheth displaced long ago.



According to Magistrate von Zarkyn, Kheth is quite knowledgeable about the world. However, the dragon rarely imparts information free of charge, often demanding a donation to its growing hoard or some other service in exchange.

```
```

Kheth lives in a cave that overlooks the northern shore. A narrow footpath leads up to the mouth of the cave, which is encrusted with sharp crystals. Kheth has a handful of kobold lookouts that watch the cave entrance and patrol the hillside.


##### Serpent Hill
This lonely hill is a day-and-a-half’s walk from Tyrak’n. Atop it rests a crumbled ruin, in the middle of which sits an old stone shrine. The ruin was probably an abbey or temple dedicated to some ancient snake cult, as the grounds are strewn with toppled statuary depicting snake-headed men. The green dragon has a few kobold minions that patrol the forest near the hill, probably to discourage exploration of the ruin.

##### The Mysterious “Ghost Giant”
Citizens of Tyrak’n who explore the misty southern beach at low tide occasionally spot enormous footprints in the sand, leading to and from the nearby woods. It is commonly believed that a giant lives somewhere on the island, although it has yet to reveal itself to the people of Tyrak’n. Jegger Trout, the captain of the guard, believes it’s a hill giant, but attempts to locate “the Ghost Giant” or its lair have proven fruitless.


##### Vorkon
The island of Vorkon can be seen from Kheth’s northern shore. The savage orcs and ogres that inhabit Vorkon belong to the Firespear tribe, so named because they like to douse their spears in flaming pitch. These fell creatures have dark gray skin covered with warpaint, but they don’t wear much armor. The Firespear chieftain has never been seen, although there’s a standing bounty of 1,000 crowns on its head. (The bounty was issued by Magistrate Lenya von Zarkyn in 1420 DY and is still honored by the current magistrate.) An active volcano rises up from the jungles of Vorkon, spewing a thin plume of black smoke and white ash into the sky. If Vorkon has a dragon overlord, no one in Tyrak’n has seen it.


##### Other Islands Near Kheth
Most of the other islands within easy reach of Kheth are barren shards of volcanic rock jutting angrily out of the sea. They serve as perches for harpies that feast on fish and the occasional sailor. The closest Arkhosian islands of consequence are the Sister Islands, Castanamir and Mheletros. Io’galaroth, the City of Caves, is hewn out of the dark cliffs of Castanamir, while Mheletros is home to a massive Dragovar prison-fortress called Zardkarath.

### YOUR ORIGIN STORY
The campaign begins on the isle of Kheth, which begs the question: Are you a native of the island, or did events conspire to bring you here? This section describes some likely origin stories for your character. Once you’ve chosen or concocted a story for your character, you can begin to hash out the details with your DM.
<div style='margin-top:16px'></div>



##### YOU'RE TYRAK'N BORN
You are a Tyrak’n native. Your family lives in town and either fishes, forages, tends a modest garden, or runs a small business. You are friends with just about everyone in town, although you’ve probably forged a very close bond with at least one of the individuals listed under Personalities of Tyrak’n (above).

If you are a half-elf between the age of 17 and 25, you may choose to be the son or daughter of Magistrate von Zarkyn, giving you a fair amount of local clout. Your father is a shrewd leader and has taken great pains over the years to appease the island’s green dragon overlord and uphold his grandfather’s good name. Your mother is warm and funny in private, but surprisingly aloof and formal in public. You fear that there’s something important she hasn’t told you or your father . . . a secret she’s likely to carry to her grave.

If you are a halfling between the age of 17 and 25, you may have had a troubled older or younger brother named Kynt who disappeared four years ago. Kynt broke the law when he persuaded two other local youths (a human boy named Jesper and a half-elf girl named Vazia) to join him on an expedition to the ruins atop Serpent Hill. No one is allowed there, by order of the magistrate. Kynt and his friends never returned, and the magistrate refused to send a hunting party to find them.
<div style='margin-top:14px'></div>



##### YOU'RE A SHIPWRECKED ORPHAN
Nineteen years ago, a ship called the Morrow’s Folly crashed on the island of Kheth during a freak storm. The only survivors were the captain—a half-elf named Denarion Morrow—and several young children. You were very young at the time (2–5 years old then, making you 21–26 years old now), so you don’t remember anything. 

You and the other children were adopted by the local townsfolk and raised as native Tyrak’ns. Although he’s not much of a father figure, Captain Morrow has been watching over you all these years, but he still claims that he can’t remember anything that happened before the shipwreck. You have no clue where you came from, or who your real parents are. You are friends with just about everyone in town, although you’ve probably forged a very close bond with at least one of the individuals listed under Personalities of Tyrak’n (above).

Four years ago, three of your friends (a troubled halfling boy named Kynt, a curious human lad named Jesper, and a half-elf girl named Vazia) left town to explore Serpent Hill, even though locals are strictly forbidden to go there. They never returned. Captain Morrow urged Magistrate von Zarkyn to send a patrol to locate them, but the magistrate refused. The two men haven’t spoken since. Jesper and Vazia were survivors of the Morrow’s Folly shipwreck, and Captain Morrow regrets not going after them himself.


##### YOU'RE FORSAKEN
You were born and raised elsewhere, brought to the island of Kheth by ship, and, for whatever reason, left behind. Hoping to find your place in the community, you’ve probably forged a close bond with at least one of the individuals listed under Personalities of Tyrak’n.

If you are a dragonborn, you may be the son or daughter of parents who were exiled from Arkhosian soil. One or both of your parents may have been pirates or outspoken opponents of the Dragovar monarchy. In either case, they probably figured you’d be safe on a small, backwater island of little consequence to the rest of the Dragovar empire.

If you are an elf between the age of 24 and 30, you may choose to be the son or daughter of Lady Thariel von Zarkyn from a previous marriage. Your father is a wealthy ship captain named Torel Winterleaf who recently made some powerful enemies. Three weeks ago, you were spirited out of Io’calioth by your father’s servants, smuggled aboard the tradeship Lantheon, and sent to stay with your mother for your own safety. You never got a chance to say goodbye to your father, and your mother didn’t exactly welcome you with open arms. It’s been 23 years after all, and your sudden arrival has created unrest in Von Zarkyn Manor. For his part, Magistrate von Zarkyn seems to be handling the situation quite well, particularly since your mother never told him she had a child with her previous husband.

If you are a tiefling between the age of 17 and 25, you may choose to be the niece or nephew of Lucius Vezetus, the friendly proprietor of the Talisman. You were born and raised in the slums of Io’calioth, and several years ago your parents brought you to see “Uncle Lucius” as a child and left you with him without explanation. Although he makes you do chores around the tavern, your uncle has been very forgiving of your irksome adolescent antics. When asked about your parents, he merely frowns and grumbles in Infernal.

##### NONE OF THE ABOVE
Perhaps you’ve come to Kheth for entirely different reasons. As a result, you may or may not have forged strong ties with the community. Some brief suggestions are listed below:

- Someone you care about was arrested ten years ago by Dragovar authorities and sent to the prison island of Mheletros. You believe this person was imprisoned wrongfully, and the key to clearing his or her good name rests with a missing sea captain named Denarion Morrow . . . whom you’ve finally tracked to this backwater town.
- You swindled or double-crossed a sea captain named Lydia Taralan, only to discover afterward that she was working for Sea King Senestrago. Upon learning the truth, you fled aboard the hammership Lantheon, headed for Tyrak’n. You’ve opted to lay low until things blow over.
- The church of Avandra has sent you to Tyrak’n to assist the local priest, Sister Alyson. She specifically requested “someone gifted with an adventurous spirit.” Alyson believes that certain townsfolk are blessed with an adventurous nature that will soon manifest, but they need Avandra’s assistance to survive their travails. 
- You had a vivid dream about a silver dragon. It asked you to travel to the island of Kheth and locate a man named Johias Ilum. The dragon in your dreams sounded real enough, and it also claimed that the rewards for your success would be great.

<div style='margin-top:16px'></div>

#### Fathomreaver

___

*Fathomreaver* is a cutlass with the power to unite the Sea Kings of Iomandra under one banner, judged worthy of its power.

### ASTRAL GIANTS

<div style='margin-top:12px'></div>

One group of giants switched sides during the Dawn
War and took up the service of the god Erathis, forsaking the primordials. These giants left the natural
world behind and migrated to the Astral Sea, where
they eventually became known as astral giants.
Few among the people of the natural world have
even the slightest idea that the astral giants exist.

They rarely return to the world, and even in the
Astral Sea they are a rare sight to see. They continue
to serve Erathis, operating as agents and pacifying
troops in places where the god of civilization has
a vested interest. One such location is the astral
dominion of Shorn, the White Desert. Here, a force of
astral giants has established a beachhead among the
deserted temples in order to launch strikes against
demons, devils, and other foul creatures that have
taken up residence in this place once known as a
center of knowledge. 

<div style='margin-top:12px'></div>

>#### Lore:
>
>Only some scholars know of half-formed legends and
snippets of folklore concerning a race of giants that
worked with the gods and mortal races to save the
world during the Dawn War. One reference from the
Book of Mystrak suggests that these giants migrated
to the Astral Sea as the Dawn War came to a close.

### PURPLE DRAGONS

___
Consummate hunters and born Manipulators,
purple dragons delight in exploration more than any
other wyrm, especially if that exploration leads farther into the earth. They love discovering places below the roots of mountains never before trod by sentient creatures, and they dream about the wonders undiscovered caverns might hold. For these reasons, purple dragons are sometimes referred to as deep dragons.

<div style='margin-top:40px'></div>



Purple dragons are relatively unknown on the surface, and when they are seen in the cloaking shadow of subterranean settings are sometimes misidentified as black dragons. They are far more common in the Underdark, though still rarely seen.
A purple dragon is sinuous, serpentine, and agile
as a cat, despite its great bulk. It has a slender head
and neck and a set of swept-back narrow wings, all
of which allow it to squeeze through narrow spaces.
When illuminated, the scales of its armored body
gleam with the deep purple luster of amethyst, but in dim light, the dragon looks nearly black.

If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

## Appendix C: Names

___
No matter what the campaign, Dungeon Masters need a ready supply of names for NPCs created on the fly. The following lists were instrumental in naming NPCs for the Iomandra campaign, and DMs are urged to pillage these lists for their own games and even expand on them. If you're a DM looking for even more names, try doing a Google search on "Czech names," "Egyptian names," or some other nationality. A lot of foreign names fit perfectly well in a D&D medieval fantasy milieu.

First names are separated from last names, allowing DMs to "mix and match" as they see fit. Only the core Player's Handbook races are represented, but at the end you'll also find a list of names that can serve double duty as ship names and inn/tavern names.
