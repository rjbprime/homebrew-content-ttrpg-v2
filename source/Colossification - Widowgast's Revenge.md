- **Duration:**  8 hours
___


Touching a willing beast or familiar and gently whispering words of power, you make it grow to incredible proportions.  It gains the following benefits while the spell lasts.  

- The touched creature become Gargantuan. If there isn't enough room for it to increase size, it makes a Strength (Athletics) check to break through the surrounding material.  It otherwise attains the maximum possible size in the space available. 
- Its current and maximum hit points increase to 200.
- Its Strength and Constitution scores increase to 26.
- It can take the Attack action.
- Its reach becomes 15 feet.
- If it already has an attack, that attack now deals 34 (4d12 + 8) damage.
- Whether or not it originally had an attack, it can perform a bite attack that deals 34 (4d12 + 8) piercing damage.  If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 20). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the familiar can't bite another target.

```
```

- As an action, the familiar can make one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the familiar, and it takes 28 (8d6) acid damage at the start of each of the familiar's turns.</br>If the familiar takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the familiar must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the familiar. 
- It has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
- It adds your proficiency bonus to its attack rolls, Strength checks, AC, and saving throws.
- Its attacks deal double damage against objects and structures and count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
- It becomes immune to being charmed and frightened.
- Once during the spell, it can choose to succeed on a saving throw.
- It does not disappear when reduced to 0 hit points.  Instead, it makes death saving throws like you do.  It disappears if it has three failed death saving throws.
- It ignores difficult terrain as it simply powers through it.

While transformed, your familiar cannot be dismissed and then resummoned.  If any creatures are inside it when the spell ends, they fall prone within in a space which the familiar previously occupied.   You can end the spell early as an action.
